										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>MULVANE, Kan. – The mission for gold buckle No. 2 is complete for steer roper Cole Patterson.<br /><br />Patterson, who had a record-setting regular season earnings mark, took care of business Saturday night to claim his second career gold buckle at the <a href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/">National Finals</a> Steer Roping at the Kansas Star Arena.<br /><br />&#8220;This a weight lifted off my shoulders,&#8221; said Patterson, 28. &#8220;It was a heck of year and when you come in with a $25,000 lead and even though the money is so good here, you are still expected to win. That adds a little pressure to an already pressure-packed situation. That&#8217;s why I do it, to get put in these pressure situations.<br /><br />&#8220;The only thing better than those pressure situations is when you execute in those situations and the feeling it gives you. This is just a relief.&#8221;<br /><br />Patterson added his latest gold buckle to the first one he captured in 2021. The Pratt, Kan., cowboy finished atop the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $166,710.<br /><br />With things getting quite interesting, Patterson slammed the door on the competition with his slick 9.9-second Round 9 winning run to clinch the coveted world title. He earned $10,160 for the round win.<br /><br />&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure of the exact numbers going into Round 9,&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;But I knew I had an excellent steer. Scott (Snedecor) tied that steer in 10 (seconds, Friday). I knew that steer was so good, and I knew if we went and made our run, we were going to get a good check in the round and probably seal the deal up and we did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snedecor finished second in the world standings with $144,452, thanks to earning an NFSR-best $51,415. Cody Lee ($132,011), Jess Tierney ($127,914) and Slade Wood ($116,655) rounded out the top five in the world standings.<br /><br />Patterson wasn&#8217;t spectacular in Mulvane, but solid.<br /><br />He placed in six rounds, including winning Round 2 (12.2 seconds) and Round 9 and left town after earning $45,195 at the NFSR. He rode his award-winning horse Tigger in Rounds 6 through 10.<br /><br />&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what to expect coming into (Saturday night),&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;Even when guys get off to a good start the first night sometimes the cards don&#8217;t fall their way the second night. I knew I needed day money. I needed to tie steers fast and that horse just has a special quality that whenever the pressure is on, he knows it and he works even better than usually does. He took care of me (Saturday night) and set me up to tie some fast steers.&#8221; <br /><br />This gold buckle was special for Patterson, since it was his first since he and his wife, Natalie, had their first child, a boy, Pruitt, who was born in June.<br /><br />&#8220;As awesome as the gold buckle is, that boy is the best thing that has ever happened to me,&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;It takes a little bit of the pressure off when you can come here (to the NFSR) and know that no matter what happens my wife and son are going to be at home. It is not a do or die situation even though sometimes it feels like it is.&#8221;<br /><br />It was truly a special night for Patterson family. Rocky, Cole&#8217;s father and four-time PRCA Steer Roping World Champion (2009-10, 2012 and 2016), won the average with 132.8 seconds on 10 head and he earned $30,349.<br /><br />This was Rocky&#8217;s third average crown, as he also accomplished the feat in 1999 and 2001. Patterson was the only roper to tie down all 10 steers.<br /><br />Cole and Rocky, who is 58 years old, are the first son and father to win a world championship and the average at the same NFSR.<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to have my dad win the average and me win the world,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;It is the coolest rodeo moment for me to date, and I don&#8217;t know what will top it. He ropes so good, which I&#8217;m not surprised by because he does it all the time. To win it with dad and take home both saddles is the coolest thing in rodeo.&#8221;<br /><br />This was Rocky&#8217;s 28th appearance at the NFSR, second only to ProRodeo Hall of Famer Guy Allen&#8217;s 33 NFSR trips.<br /><br />Back in 2021, when Cole won his first world title, the Pattersons became the third father and son to win steer roping world championships. They joined John McEntire (1934) and Clark McEntire (1956-57); and Charles Good (1975) and Gary Good (1979).<br /><br />The Pattersons became the fifth father and son to win the average at the NFSR when Cole won the average in 2021, joining the company of Jim Snively (1959), and Joe Snively (1961, 72); James Allen (1971) and Guy Allen (1989, 1991, 1997, 2000, 2004); Charles Good (1976) and Gary Good (1979); and Jim Davis (1988) and Bryce Davis (2009).<br /><br />Reo Lohse, who finished eighth in the world standings with $91,317, won the Dixon McGowan Award, given to the highest-ranked first-time qualifier to the NFSR. The award memorializes McGowan, who died at age 23 in an automobile accident on May 10, 1997.<br /><br />Lohse won Round 8 with a 10.5-second run.<br /><br />Cole and Rocky Patterson weren&#8217;t the only ropers celebrating Saturday night.<br /><br />Tony Reina won the PRCA Legacy Steer Roping Finals at the Kansas Star with 52.3 seconds on four head. Reina clinched the title at the Legacy Finals with a 12.4-second run in Round 4, the final round of the competition. Martin Poindexter won the Legacy Steer Roping season title.</p>

<p>Will Lummus knew it would be a long weekend to come out on top in the steer wrestling at the RAM Southeastern Circuit Finals Rodeo in Davie, Fla. Coming into the weekend, he was sitting third overall. In round one he placed second with a 4.5-second run and placed third in round two with a 4.6-second effort. When the third round rolled around, the pressure was on.<br /><br />Lummus is no stranger to high stakes. He is a five-time <a href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/">Wrangler National Finals Rodeo</a> qualifier, winning the average in Vegas in 2021.<br /><br />&#8220;I had to win the round and win the average to have the opportunity to win the circuit,&#8221; Lummus said. &#8220;My last run, I knew the steer was good. Tyler Waguespack won the second round with the same score of 3.8 on the same steer.&#8221;<br /><br />While Lummus is a regular on the road out West to make it to the NFR, he likes competing in the Southeastern Circuit throughout the year.<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s where I&#8217;m from and my kind of people,&#8221; Lummus said.<br /><br />It&#8217;s been an exciting year competing in the circuit for Lummus for one special reason. In December he bought a new horse specifically to compete in the circuit rodeos and it paid off. Lummus went on to win two of the biggest rodeos in the circuit, Kissimmee, Fla., and Montgomery, Ala.<br /><br />&#8220;Wins mean a little more when you own the horses,&#8221; Lummus said. &#8220;My new horse and my hazing horse did so good throughout the year.&#8221;<br /><br />When reflecting on the weekend, Lummus said he was happy about the final results.<br /><br />&#8220;They upped the added money, which is awesome,&#8221; Lummus said. &#8220;The producers of the rodeo, the Weekley Brothers and the town of Davie put on a good rodeo for the cowboys and cowgirls.&#8221;<br /><br />Lummus was able to place in each round, which ultimately led him to the Southeastern Circuit Finals Rodeo title.<br /><br />Up next is a trip to the Wrangler NFR, Dec. 7-16, at the Thomas &amp;. Mack Center in Las Vegas.<br /><br />Other winners of the $250,694 rodeo were bareback rider Taylor Broussard (249.5 points on three head); team ropers Bart Brunson/ Clay Green (18 seconds on three head); saddle bronc rider Shea Fournier (167 points on two head); tie-down roper Cole Walker (23.5 seconds on three head); breakaway roper Laramie Johnson (8.6 seconds on three head); barrel racer Chloe Gray (43.59 seconds on three runs); and bull rider Lucas Mooningham (159 points on two head).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trey Watts looked over the order of go and knew what he had to do. <br /><br />At the North American Championship Rodeo, which serves as the RAM Great Lakes Circuit Finals Rodeo, the Palmyra, Mo., saddle bronc rider had gotten off to a slow start. His first-go effort of 78 points was solid, but not good enough to place among the top four scores and earn him any money. <br /><br />After reviewing the second-go order, Watts found himself as the last man up. <br /><br />&#8220;The second round was our semi-eliminators, and they posted the buck order beforehand, so I knew I was last and I kind of knew what I had to be. And I knew I had one of the more rider-friendly ones in that round,&#8221; Watts said. &#8220;I had actually been on him before and he kind of led me around, but I just knew if I started him good, he&#8217;d be good, and it all worked out pretty good.&#8221;<br /><br />His 81.5-point effort on Championship Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Bonafide ended up being the highest scoring saddle bronc ride of the entire rodeo. The momentum didn&#8217;t stop there as Watts posted a third-round effort of 81 points on Dakota Rodeo&#8217;s Back Page, propelling him to an aggregate score of 240.5 points on three-head, good enough to hold off Byron Gilliland by seven points for the title.<br /><br />Success in the Great Lakes Circuit is nothing new to Watts as he has previously won the season-long circuit championship and placed runner-up in 2020 and 2021 at the culminating rodeo competition.<br /><br />Despite only being a rookie during the 2023 season, Watts has seen a lot of action competing on his permit. He&#8217;s quickly learned that his riding prowess is only half the battle to being successful in the sport, which makes weekends like this last one so important. <br /><br />&#8220;Looking back now, I didn&#8217;t realize it then, but I had a lot of things go my way (when I won the circuit). I drew really good all year. And the past couple years, I kind of struggled to draw good,&#8221; Watts said. &#8220;This year, I just didn&#8217;t let myself get down if I didn&#8217;t draw good and I just tried to capitalize when I did have a good one. I won some really cool rodeos this year, but it was kind of feast or famine I would say. But it was a good year I would say.&#8221;<br /><br />The win in Louisville, Ky., gives Watts a head start on the 2024 season, putting just shy of $8,300 on his ledger for the new year. <br /><br />If he can draw a few good horses this winter, the up-and-coming saddle bronc rider could set himself up for a special season. It&#8217;s a challenge Watt is excited to face. <br /><br />&#8220;This win was really important. Hopefully I can get into some of these bigger winter rodeos now that I have a little bit of money won,&#8221; he said. <br /><br />Other winners at the $219,806 rodeo were all-around cowboy Fenton Nelsen ($7,376, tie-down roping and steer wrestling); bareback rider Tanner Aus (243.5 points on three head); steer wrestler Chance Carlson (15.0 seconds on three head); team ropers Cody Reed/Jace McDaniel, (11.6 seconds on two head); tie-down roper Dallen McIntire (26.5 seconds on three head, $3,688); barrel racer Lacinda Rose (46.03 seconds on three head); bull rider Jarett Evans (165.5 points on two head).</p>

<p>RED DEER, Alberta – He just keeps racking them up.</p>
<p>Make it four in a row for Canadian saddle bronc riding sensation Zeke Thurston.</p>
<p>The defending Canadian and PRCA World Champion earned his latest title while winning $40,695 during the 49th edition of the Canadian Finals Rodeo in Red Deer, pushing his Canadian season earnings to $89,186.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Big Valley, Alberta, cowboy who&#8217;s seemed bullet proof, gave fans a scare with a rare buckoff on his very first horse at the CFR, but he bounced back to win three straight go-rounds, then a third place, and tied for first with Logan Hay on his last horse Sunday with an 88.25-point ride on Calgary Stampede&#8217;s Tokyo Bubbles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The competition is stiff,&#8221; Thurston said. &#8220;It&#8217;s never a lay-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;They always joke all roads to a Canadian title go through Zeke Thurston, but I really wish they wouldn&#8217;t say that, because it&#8217;s not a gimme. It&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s game when you get out here. They threw me off the first one, and I was just lucky enough to draw good and put together a few more good rides and got myself back in the thick of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The win etches Thurston into the Canadian pro rodeo record books, as the first to win four consecutive saddle bronc championships, surpassing the three each won by Kenny McLean and Mel Coleman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know what to say about that,&#8221; Thurston said. &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty elite company right there. This is a bunch of outstanding bronc riders, and great horses. I can&#8217;t say enough about all of them. I love the competition and a good battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheering Thurston on was his family, including the newest addition, baby girl Maggie Mae, born Oct. 26.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really special. We just had our third. To be able to share this with your family – there&#8217;s no better feeling,&#8221; Thurston said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the memories are all about. It&#8217;s not the buckles, it&#8217;s not the money. It&#8217;s sharing those moments with your loved ones, and just enjoying them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thurston will head to his ninth <a href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/">Wrangler NFR</a> next month, where the possibility of repeating last year&#8217;s two country sweep, and a fourth PRCA world title, is there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be really nice to ride this wave down to Vegas and keep things rolling and do our deal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hopefully we draw good and put together some good rides.&#8221;</p>
<p>The highest CFR and season money winners were team ropers Brady Tryan and Calgary Smith, who won the average and the Canadian title, picking up $62,838 with a record fast 24.3 seconds on six head during the Finals, for a season tally of $91,494. Other Canadian champions at the $1.4 million dollar event include all-around champion Logan Spady ($22,861 CFR; $60,894 Season); bareback rider Clint Laye, 516.5 on six head ($53,262 CFR; Season $90,894); bull rider Edgar Durazo, 437.25 on five rides ($46,320 CFR; Season $82,467); steer wrestler Scott Guenthner, 32.9 seconds on six runs ($42,729 CFR; Season $73,326); tie-down roper Haven Meged, 53.8 seconds on six runs ($45,123 CFR; Season $82,482); barrel racer Lynette Brodoway, 88.23 seconds on six runs ($25,016 CFR; $72,831 Season); breakaway roper Shaya Beiver, 7.6 seconds on three runs ($13,933 CFR; Season $32,444).</p>

<p>Unstoppable. Almost unbeatable. That&#8217;s been bareback rider Evan Betony in the last few months.</p>
<p>The multi-time RAM Turquoise Circuit Champion won no less than second in six of the final seven rodeos of his ProRodeo regular season to carry a lead of better than $5,000 into the RAM Turquoise Circuit Finals Rodeo in Camp Verde, Ariz., on Nov. 3.</p>
<p>But before he climbed aboard his first horse, Betony took care of business in Las Vegas during the Indian National Finals Rodeo (INFR), winning or sharing three round wins en route to his first world title.</p>
<p>Just one week later, the Navajo cowboy carried that momentum into the circuit finals, where he swept the competition, winning all three rounds and the average with 242.5 points. Betony earned $8,574.</p>
<p>Betony followed his father, uncle, and older brother into the rough and tumble world of bareback riding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing up, the people I looked up to were bareback riders and I just found a niche for it,&#8221; Betony, 24, said. His father Philbert took his boys, Wyatt, Evan, and Cauy, along with him on the ProRodeo trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d go with him, and I guess it&#8217;s just monkey-see, monkey-do,&#8221; Betony joked. His own son, Huxtyn, is already following his dad behind the bucking chutes at just three years old, so the Betony bareback riding legacy may well go on.</p>
<p>But first, Hux&#8217;s dad is making his own mark, claiming his third Turquoise Circuit Finals Rodeo championship since 2019 in dominating fashion.</p>
<p>It all started on Friday night with a horse from Salt River Rodeo called Windy Whiskey, a horse with whom Betony had plenty of history.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was good, just had her normal trip like when I&#8217;ve gotten on her in Payson (Ariz.) a few times,&#8221; Betony said of the 81.5-point ride. &#8220;I guess I was on my game a little that day because we got the round win.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final day of the finals features two performances, a grueling day for bareback riders in particular. Betony&#8217;s matinee dancing partner, Divine Porcupine from Honeycutt Rodeo, did not make things easier for champion.</p>
<p>&#8220;She bucked,&#8221; Betony laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m still feeling a little sore this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a second-round win for a 79-point ride, Betony held a 7.5-point lead going into the final round on Saturday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tonight, I had Jim Kenney&#8217;s Ship Shape,&#8221; Betony said. &#8220;She&#8217;s kind of small but has a big heart. She was snappy and good and made me work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Betony sealed the sweep with 82 points, taking the average easily and his third-year end title. The win also sets up a chance for redemption at next summer&#8217;s NFR Open powered by RAM in Colorado Springs, Colo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had luck up there in Colorado Springs in the past, but we&#8217;ll look to change that this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Betony continues to rack up the titles, he isn&#8217;t planning on hitting the road full time. Along with Huxtyn, Betony and Kaitlan James have a little girl, Keeley, who is just a year old.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to (go harder) but I&#8217;m taking care of my family and they&#8217;re my main focus,&#8221; Betony said. &#8220;What I am able to do on the weekends just helps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe if I start winning big, I will go more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other winners at the $198,314 rodeo were all-around cowboy Erich Rogers ($8,394, team roping and steer roping); steer wrestler Rooster Yazzie (15.9 seconds on three head); team ropers Erich Rogers/Paul Eaves (15.5 seconds on three head); saddle bronc rider Slade Keith (244.5 points on three head); tie-down roper Seth Hall (29.2 seconds on three head); barrel racer Madison Bean (52.65 seconds on three runs); breakaway roper Kassidy Dennison (9.6 seconds on three head); steer roper Garrett Hale (33.8 seconds on three head); and bull rider Caelan Reynolds (171.5 points on two head).</p>

<p>The cowboy who set the gold standard for PRCA bareback riders has called it a career.</p>
<p>Kaycee Feild, who has won a record six PRCA Bareback Riding World Championships (2011-14, 2020-21), confirmed to the ProRodeo Sports News that he&#8217;s retiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, it&#8217;s actually kind of a weight lifted off my shoulders,&#8221; said Feild, 36, about announcing his retirement. &#8220;What I&#8217;m feeling, it is a pretty dang good feeling. I&#8217;m happy where I&#8217;m at, it feels good to be home with my family and look forward to being here, not missing games, junior rodeos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feild obtained his PRCA card in 2007 and qualified for the <a href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/">National Finals Rodeo</a> 13 times – (2008-15, 2018-22) tied for fifth most ever for bareback riders. The Genola, Utah, cowboy won the average – a bareback riding record – five times in 2011-14 and 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so grateful for the sport of rodeo,&#8221; Feild said. &#8220;What I have from the sport, the opportunities it presented me with are humbling experiences. I got to go overseas with the National Patriot Tour and that was a lifechanging event to go over and see war firsthand and give thanks. That was presented to me because I had a cowboy hat, a pair of cowboy boots and a bareback riggin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just a humbling place I&#8217;m in and I&#8217;m extremely grateful for the career I had and the success I had and the friendships I developed with the committeemen, cameramen, traveling partners, competitors, pickup men, gatemen, you name it. I have friendships that are special to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bucking horses and accolades I have in the sport mean a lot to me. It was an extremely fun career that I was blessed to have. I was blessed with a durable body and a lot of people who kept me motivated. My family was a big part of every bit of it. My wife (Stephanie) was the best teammate a guy could have. The things I learned along the way, the ups and downs that the humbling sport of rodeo is, it makes me so excited for the next chapter and confident in the direction I&#8217;m going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaycee and his wife, have three children, daughters Chaimberlyn, 10, and Remi, 5; and son, Huxyn, 8.</p>
<p>Feild, who also has a PRCA bareback riding record 29 NFR round wins, was coming to grips with retirement for a little while.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had my goals set at the beginning of the year to take my family as much as could and that was the No. 1 goal,&#8221; Feild said. &#8220;Obviously, a goal of mine was to be the world champion and not crossing that off hurts and to not retire at the NFR hurts. It is not the dream I had but it (retiring) is what I wanted more than anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been five years that I have been talking to my wife (about retirement) and listening to some older athletes and friends who have retired over the years. It was evident to me last year come July if it wasn&#8217;t going to retire at the end of 2022, then for sure in 2023.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feild said his decision has nothing to do with injuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still feel great physically and mentally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s crazy that I have the least inflammation in my body since 2012. I was worried about what was going to be my motivator when I was done rodeoing to stay physically fit. I thought it was going to be hard to get in the gym, but I have found motivation of &#8216;How good can you feel.&#8217; You&#8217;re not going to go to the rodeo and get beat up and start getting hurt. Your ribs aren&#8217;t going to hurt. Your shoulder is OK, your wrist is just fine, this is amazing. &#8216;How far are you going to push and how good are you going to feel.&#8217; This makes it a little more fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaycee followed in the footsteps of his father, the late Lewis Feild, a ProRodeo Hall of Famer, and five-time PRCA World Champion in all-around 1987-89; and bareback riding 1985-86.</p>
<p>Kaycee had eight 90-point rides at the NFR, including five in the last three years. His last ride at the 2022 NFR he won Round 10 with a 92-point ride on Pickett Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Night Crawler.</p>
<p>Since 2011, Feild has registered 25 90-point rides or better.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find it hard to talk about it still,&#8221; Feild said of his career accomplishments. &#8220;It&#8217;s unreal and extremely humbling now that I&#8217;m able to look back on it. I&#8217;m not lying in bed and dreaming of riding bucking horses and the competing, it is lay my head down and rest and dream of what I have accomplished and how to utilize those tools into the next chapter into the next discipline.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his decorated career, Feild found enjoyment in the arena in different ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;It varied throughout my career,&#8221; Feild said. &#8220;I obviously loved riding bucking horses. I knew from a young age that&#8217;s what I wanted to do. Throughout my career, my favorite thing was drawing the toughest horses. I loved the challenge. I loved the hype behind big bad bucking horses and to be in the mental state to go at that horse with full confidence that was extremely fun. The most fun thing for me is when my family could be at the rodeos and have a win. It always fun to have them there and when I got to have my family come out on the stage and accept the awards with me and have my wife and kids feel that, because it was a full team, was special. I also can&#8217;t deny the friendships.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside of rodeo, Field has several businesses he&#8217;s involved with.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m excited and motivated about,&#8221; Feild said. &#8220;I still have PWR PRO that we have had for five years, and it is doing well. Our products are well liked in the Western community and to feel that support is humbling. My brother Shad and I have Warbonnet Cowboy hats, and he operates it and having a business with my brother is a blast. I&#8217;ve learned a lot from him. My newest venture is called KTK Fulfillment. We are Fulfillment center, and we will store your products and fulfill your orders. It is a very fast-paced business, and it is fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;My business partners in KTK, Kaden (Mower) and Thomas (Mower) are very sharp guys and they have taught me a lot. We are great friends, so it makes it even more fun. It is a lot like a traveling partner, they are going to call me on my BS, just like Tilden (Hooper) did my whole career. They let know if you made a mistake and they support you and educate you in the coolest way. They are very successful guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for rodeo plans, Feild has no long-term plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to go down and fulfill my obligations with my endorsements and brands I represent at the (2023 NFR),&#8221; Feild said. &#8220;Then, after that I find myself thinking I will probably step away from rodeo and pursue some different things for a year or two. But I love the sport and I have a lot of passion for it and there are so many great people in it. There are so many great things I love about the sport. I see myself a few years down the road somehow being involved. I will do a couple of schools next, and I plan on helping bareback riding and hopefully I can create more bareback riding athletes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, my passion and my focus are my family and KTK, PWR PRO and Warbonnet. It is a crazy fast pace and I find the more I live my life like an eight-second ride and stay busy hustling all day, it helps me stay grounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red Steagall, who has had a 45-plus year entertainment career that has spanned the globe from Cow Camps to the White House, will add another line to his resume in 2023.</p>
<p>Steagall has been named the 2023 Legend of ProRodeo.</p>
<p>Cervi will be honored at the 18th annual Wrangler Gold Buckle Gala on Dec. 4 at the South Point Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Doors open at 6 p.m. (PT) with a reception and silent auction. The dinner begins at 7 p.m. with the live auction and program following dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a tremendous honor to be recognized as a member of that family that has meant so much to me and been such a major part of my life,&#8221; Steagall said. &#8220;I&#8217;m proud to know that they accept me, and the rest of that community accepts me and I&#8217;m a part of the rodeo family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steagall&#8217;s career spanned the globe from Australia to the Middle East, to South America and to the Far East. He has performed for heads of state, including a special party for President Ronald Reagan at the White House in 1983, plus three overseas tours to the Middle East, the Far East, Europe, Australia, and South America.</p>
<p>As a native Texan, Red Steagall enjoyed a career in Agricultural Chemistry after graduating from West Texas A&amp;M University with a degree in Animal Science and Agronomy. He then spent eight years as a music industry executive in Hollywood, Calif., and has spent the last 37 years as a recording artist, songwriter, and TV motion picture personality.</p>
<p>He currently ranches outside of Fort Worth, Texas, where in addition to his entertainment activities, he is involved in numerous horse related activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;This (Legend of ProRodeo) is a real milestone,&#8221; Steagall said. &#8220;It is something I never dreamed would be possible because as far I&#8217;m concerned that title in rodeo belongs to the athletes and to the people who make the rodeo really work. To think they believe I have contributed that much in my life is overwhelming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Red Steagall is best known for his wonderful Texas Swing dance music and such songs as &#8220;Here We Go Again&#8221;, &#8220;Party Dolls and Wine&#8221;, &#8220;Freckles Brown&#8221;, and &#8220;Lone Star Beer and Bob Wills Music&#8221;, he also is beloved by Texas cowboys for the quiet times they have spent with him around chuck wagon campfires.</p>
<p>As a songwriter, Steagall has had over 200 of his compositions recorded both by him and other artists. He also has recorded 26 consecutive singles that tracked on the national charts and released a total of 22 albums.</p>

<p>CHEYENNE, Wyo. –  There was a look of disbelief on Ryder Sanford&#8217;s face.<br /> <br />The Sulphur, La., cowboy was trying to digest the fact he won the storied Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo moments earlier.<br /> <br />Not only did Sanford win, he also set a new rodeo record with his 92.5-point ride on Sankey Pro Rodeo &amp; Phenom Genetics&#8217; Black Tie at Frontier Park on Sunday.<br /> <br />The CFD saddle bronc riding record was a 91-point ride by fellow Louisiana cowboy Cody DeMoss on Harry Vold Rodeo&#8217;s Painted Valley in 2010.<br /> <br />&#8220;This is awesome,&#8221; said Sanford, 24. &#8220;I Iook up to Cody as a bronc rider and to carry this on is just amazing.&#8221;<br /> <br />Sanford couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better draw. Black Tie was the 2022 Pendleton Whisky&#8217;s Let &#8216;er Buck Saddle Bronc Horse of the Year.<br /> <br />&#8220;That horse absolutely was as good as advertised,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the one that everyone was wishing to have by their name, and I was blessed to have him by mine and he was just awesome.&#8221;<br /> <br />Although there was a packed crowd and a CFD buckle on the line, Sanford, a rookie, didn&#8217;t let his nerves get the best of him.<br /> <br />&#8220;I was pretty calm actually,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I knew I was going to do everything I could to ride the best and it worked out. I knew it was going to be (a big score). An electric horse like that comes together like that it is going to be big points.&#8221;<br /> <br />When his score was posted, Sanford soaked in the moment as the crowd roared its approval at the rodeo known as the &#8220;Daddy of &#8217;em All.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;It is like nothing else,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;It was amazing.&#8221;<br /> <br />Last season, Sanford was competing on his PRCA permit, but he had his season cut short by injury.<br /> <br />&#8220;I hurt my shoulder in the summer, and I had to take time off,&#8221; Sanford said.<br /> <br />Sanford has rebounded nicely in 2023, winning several rodeos, including the Casey Tibbs Match of Champions Xtreme Broncs in Fort Pierre, S.D. He has been hovering around the top 20 in the PRCA | RAM World Standings and he&#8217;s optimistic Cheyenne will be a springboard for him to get in the Top 15 in the standings.<br /> <br />&#8220;This is absolutely my biggest rodeo win ever and it is going to give me good momentum for the rest of the summer and hopefully into (the NFR),&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;(Qualifying for the NFR) would mean everything to me.&#8221;<br /> <br />Sanford also shared the spotlight with Kade Sonnier, his college rodeo teammate from McNeese State in Lake Charles, La. Sonnier split the bareback riding victory in Cheyenne Sunday with an 87.5-point ride on Sankey Pro Rodeo Phenom Genetics&#8217; MLW&#8217;s Irish Eyes. Sonnier shared the win with Clayton Biglow (87.5 points on Sankey Pro Rodeo Phenom Genetics&#8217; Atomic Blonde) and Cole Reiner (87.5 points on New Star Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Chosen One).<br /> <br />&#8220;Kade and I are really good friends, so for both of us to get the win in the same year (at Cheyenne) is amazing,&#8221; Sanford said.<br /> <br />Other winners at the Playoff Series Rodeo were all-around cowboy Stetson Wright (saddle bronc riding and bull riding); steer wrestler Eli Lord (5.9 seconds); team ropers Billy Bob Brown/Kirby Blakenship (8.0 seconds); tie-down roper Luke Potter (10.6 seconds); steer roper Troy Tillard (14.6 seconds); barrel racer Sue Smith (16.89 seconds, new arena record); and bull rider Stetson Wright (91.5 points on Dakota Rodeo&#8217;s Trump Train).</p>

<p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – This season has been a phenomenal one for rookie bareback rider Keenan Hayes.<br /> <br />Hayes arrived at the NFR Open powered by RAM first in the PRCA | RAM World Standings – and he showed why Saturday night.<br /> <br />The Hayden, Colo., cowboy had an 86.5-point ride on Championship Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Pass the Hat in the four-man showdown to capture the national title before a sold-out crowd at the Norris Penrose Event Center.<br /> <br />&#8220;The last couple of hours were awesome,&#8221; said Hayes, 20. &#8220;I&#8217;m super excited to be here in Colorado Springs and win this in my home state. That horse (Pass the Hat) had a little bit of a drop to her. I heard good things about her, and I saw her the other day in Prescott, Ariz. I was super excited to have that horse and I had to cock my hammer and keep going at her. I heard the crowd get really loud and that just made keep going and make the push.&#8221;<br /> <br />Hayes, who was representing the Mountain States Circuit, was thrilled to compete at the NFR Open.<br /> <br />&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to win this back when it was the RAM National Circuit Finals and I was excited it got moved to Colorado Springs, and I got to get this win in my home state,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;All this is going to do now is just help out more (in the world standings). I have a lead and I&#8217;m just going to keep going at it and hopefully set a record.&#8221;<br /> <br />Hayes sits atop the world standings with $166,235. This year Hayes has claimed wins at Rodeo Austin (Texas), the Mountain States Circuit Finals in Loveland, Colo., and the San Angelo (Texas) Cinch Chute-Out.<br /> <br />&#8220;Nothing has really surprised me this year,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;I expect the best out of myself every time I get on one. I don&#8217;t want to do anything else but win. They have been running ones under me everywhere I have been and that&#8217;s been making my job a lot easier.&#8221;<br /> <br />Hayes advanced to the final-four Gold Buckle Round in the second position after recording an 82-point ride on Brookman Rodeo&#8217;s Joe Dirt. That set the stage for his victorious ride in the Showdown.<br /> <br />More than 200 of the top rodeo contestants from each of the 12 U.S. and Canadian Circuits, plus national champions from Mexico, converged on Colorado Springs, Colo., from July 11-15 for the 2023 NFR Open powered by RAM.<br /> <br />The NFR Open at the Pikes Peak or Bust Rodeo is one of the biggest rodeos of the ProRodeo season with $1 million in payouts to contestants, livestock and other PRCA members.<br /> <br />&#8220;This NFR Open is awesome,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;I just want to keep going at them and keep my foot on the gas.&#8221;<br /> <br />Other winners at the NFR Open were breakaway roper Maddy Deerman (3.0 seconds); steer wrestler Dirk Tavenner (11.2 seconds); team ropers Nelson Wyatt/Tyler Worley (4.4 seconds); saddle bronc rider Kade Bruno (85.5 points on Mo Betta Rodeo&#8217;s Sue City Sue); tie-down roper Garrett Jacobs (8.6 seconds); barrel racer Jessica Routier (17.69 seconds); and bull rider Trey Holston (89 points on JC Kitaif ProRodeos&#8217; Rico Suave).<br /> <br />Bruno tied Cole Elshere in the finals but was awarded the championship by virtue of a higher semifinal score. The Texas Circuit was crowned the team champ.<br /> <br />Holston was the top money earner which allowed him to claim the RAM Top Gun Award and receive a voucher for a RAM truck.</p>

<p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – Shorty Garrett knows how important PRCA&#8217;s Circuit system is.<br /><br />Back in 2020, the Badlands Circuit saddle bronc rider won the RAM National Circuit Finals Rodeo and it propelled him to his lone appearance at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo.<br /><br />Garrett is back to try and get a second national championship, this time at the NFR Open powered by RAM (formerly the RNCFR).<br /><br />The Eagle Butte, S.D., cowboy put himself in good position to claim his second national circuit title as he&#8217;s leading the average after two rides with 164.5 points. Garrett climbed to the top of the leaderboard with an 86-point ride on Beutler &amp; Son Rodeo&#8217;s Rude Roommate on Wednesday night at the Norris Penrose Event Center.<br /><br />&#8220;I had never been on that horse, and I had seen it several times and was dang sure happy to have it,&#8221; said Garrett, 30. &#8220;My horse last night (Beutler &amp; Son Rodeo&#8217;s No Show Jones, he had a 78.5-point ride) was a little weaker and I was hoping this one was going to do his job and he did. I&#8217;m dang sure in a good spot after two rides.&#8221;<br /><br />Garrett is in the mix to make a return trip to the 2023 Wrangler NFR as he is 23rd in the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $51,000. He also made sure he would be competing in the NFR Open powered by RAM.<br /><br />&#8220;We were in the first perf of the (Calgary Stampede) so we could make this happen,&#8221; Garrett said. &#8220;Then, we will go to Sheridan (Wyo.) (Thursday) and Elko, Nev. (Friday) and right back here (to Colorado Springs) Saturday.&#8221;<br /><br />The next NFR Open performance is at 7 p.m. (MT) Thursday.<br /><br />More than 200 of the top rodeo contestants from each of the 12 U.S. and Canadian Circuits, plus national champions from Mexico will converge on Colorado Springs, Colo., until July 15 for the 2023 NFR Open powered by RAM.<br /><br />The NFR Open at the Pikes Peak or Bust Rodeo kicked off Tuesday night and runs through July 15. It is one of the biggest rodeos of the ProRodeo season with $1 million in payouts to contestants, livestock and other PRCA members.<br /><br />&#8220;If you can (win the NFR Open) it will make things less stressful,&#8221; Garrett said. &#8220;Say, you&#8217;re not drawing good, and you need to get going to these rodeos and you need money won, it makes it that much easier if you can get a jump on things. I have had success at the national circuit finals rodeo, I really like it.&#8221;<br /><br />After just missing the NFR in 2021 and 2022, finishing 20th and 18th, respectively in the world standings, Garrett wants to make it to the yellow bucking chutes in Las Vegas. When Garrett competed at the Wrangler NFR in 2020 it was at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, because of COVID-19 restrictions in Las Vegas.<br /><br />&#8220;We&#8217;ve been close and we&#8217;re ready to break through and get back to the finals,&#8221; Garrett said. &#8220;It was cool we got to ride in Arlington and that was probably a once-in-a-lifetime deal, but there&#8217;s also nothing like Las Vegas. When you&#8217;re a little kid all you dream about is getting to ride in the Thomas &amp; Mack (Center). You eat, sleep and dream it and hopefully things will go my way and I will be there.&#8221;<br /><br />The remaining five performances of the NFR Open will be broadcast live on The Cowboy Channel and stream on the PRCA on The Cowboy Channel Plus App, July 12-15.</p>
