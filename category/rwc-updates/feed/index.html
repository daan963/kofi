										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to follow Rugby World Cup 2023 live and online from anywhere in the world? We&#8217;ll tell you how to stream all the matches for free and how to watch the Rugby World Cup abroad using a virtual private network (VPN).</p>
<p>For the very first time, France is hosting the Rugby World Cup. The competition will take place from <strong>September 08 to October 28,</strong> the date of the Rugby World Cup final which will take place in Saint-Denis. Good news for rugby fans around the world: with broadcasters in over 20 countries, watching the <a href="https://frontdoor.lcp.uk.com/">Rugby World Cup online</a> and live couldn&#8217;t be easier, even if you&#8217;re abroad.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that <strong>this article only recommends official sources</strong>. The Rugby World Cup is a monumental event, and as such unauthorized streams will likely be available. That said, it is essential to keep in mind that these are often slow and offer low-resolution video streams. In addition, the broadcast of the match can be interrupted at any time and prevent you from knowing the winner! Fortunately, with a large number of international broadcasters (some of which offer the matches for free), there is no need to resort to illegal streams.</p>
<h2><span id="Diffuseur_de_la_Coupe_du_Monde_sur_quelles_chaines_regarder_les_matchs_a_la_TV"><strong>WORLD CUP BROADCASTERS: ON WHICH CHANNELS TO WATCH THE MATCHES ON TV?</strong></span></h2>
<p>From Friday, September 8 to Saturday, October 28, 2023, the day of the final, the Rugby World Cup in France will punctuate our days. To follow the World Cup, you will have to zap between three channels. <strong><a href="https://www.tf1.fr/">TF1</a>, <a href="https://www.francetelevisions.fr/">France Télévisions</a>, and <a href="https://www.6play.fr/6play">M6</a> share the broadcasting rights for the 2023 Rugby World Cup matches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TF1 has had a historic partnership since 1991 with World Rugby</strong>. Originally, TF1 was the only broadcaster of the competition withholding all 48 matches of the competition. However, the channel took the decision to sub-license 28 of them to two large unencrypted audiovisual groups: <strong>France Télévisions and M6.</strong>TF1 will broadcast three of the four group matches of the XV of France, including the highly anticipated France-New Zealand opening match (Friday, September 8, 2023, at 9 p.m.). The channel will also broadcast France – Uruguay match (Thursday, September 14 at 9 p.m.) and France-Italy (Friday, October 6, 2023 at 9 p.m.). TF1 also chose to broadcast the two best quarter-finals, including the one with France, the two semi-finals, the match for third place, and the final.</p>
<p><strong>France Télévisions will broadcast 10 matches of the 2023 Rugby World Cup.</strong> The broadcaster of the six nations tournament will notably broadcast the match between France and Namibia (Thursday, September 21, 2023, at 9 p.m.) and a quarter-final. M6 will broadcast 18 tournament matches, including a quarter of the tournament. France Télévisions had not broadcast the Rugby World Cup since 2011. <strong>M6 will broadcast the competition for the first time on its channel.</strong></p>

Head to the resale service of the official ticket office. The official ticket resale platform for the 2023 World Cup in France opens this Tuesday, January 24, 2023.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Day for all rugby fans who don&#8217;t yet have their precious sesame for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France. At 7 months and 15 days before the start of the World Cup (September 8), this Tuesday, January 24, 2023, marks an important step on the road to this long-awaited deadline, since the official ticket resale platform opens its doors from 18 pm (French time).</p>
<p>Accessible on tickets.rugbyworldcup.com until the end of the 2023 World Cup, which will end on October 28 with the final at the Stade de France, it allows fans around the world to buy and resell tickets to attend the competition through a secure, transparent, and certified system. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know.</p>
<h2>6 tickets maximum per purchase</h2>
<p>Since January 12, people who bought tickets during the previous sales phases in 2021 and 2022 have the opportunity to offer their tickets on the official resale platform at a unit price depending on the match and category (<a href="https://resources.world.rugby/worldrugby/document/2022/12/08/7a6077c7-967c-4144-ab6e-06898d7b0e91/RWC-2023_PRIX_FRE.pdf">see price list</a>). But these tickets are only available for purchase from this Tuesday, January 24, in a maximum of <strong>6 tickets per buyer</strong>. Be aware that dealers will be able to <strong>drop off tickets up to 24 hours before each match</strong>. So remember to visit the site regularly to see the different matches available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Information concerning the resale: The reseller will receive the amount of the ticket whose resale is fixed at the unit price (from 10 to 950 €). The payment will be made no later than 2 months after the transaction. The tickets that make up the packs will be resold individually. If a person wishes to resell more than 6 tickets for the same match (acquired over several sales phases), he will have to do it two or more times.</li>
<li>Purchase information: The buyer will be able to purchase a maximum of 6 tickets on the official resale platform. A fee representing 10% of the total amount of the order will be applied to cover the costs of managing the platform and securing the transmission of the ticket from the reseller to the buyer. Fans will have the opportunity to donate to <em>Rugby au Cœur</em> (Official Charity of the Rugby World Cup 2023) to support meaningful projects around rugby, focused on education, equal opportunities, and health disability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>France 2023 fight against the black market</h2>
<p>Through this official resale platform, intended to offer a secure service and greater flexibility to fans wishing to participate in this great celebration of world rugby, France 2023 reaffirms its determination in the<strong> fight against the black market</strong> and the deregulation of prices practiced on illegal resale sites or on social networks, all of which are closely monitored.</p>
<p>World Rugby would like to remind fans worldwide that &#8220;tickets purchased or resold at unofficial venues do not guarantee access to Rugby World Cup 2023 stadiums and that associated orders will be canceled&#8221;. Only resale and purchase on the official resale platform will guarantee the regularity of the ticket and the legality of the transaction.</p>
<p>Rugby World Cup 2023 will take place in France. No less than 48 matches will take place in 9 cities, spread across the country: Paris (Saint-Denis), Marseille, Toulouse, Lyon, Nantes, Lille, Bordeaux, Nice, and Saint-Étienne. Get ready for the most prestigious men&#8217;s rugby tournament in the world!</p>
<p>Rugby World Cup 2023: How to get tickets?</p>
<p>The official ticket office is already open. Only one site sells tickets for the matches: rugbyworldcup.com. And if all the meetings are already full, a resale platform is open for purchase since January 24, 2023. This space allows fans from all over the world to buy and resell tickets securely to attend the competition. Tickets are offered at the price of the single sale, within the limit of 6 tickets per person. The purchase and deposit of resale tickets are possible from now until 24 hours before each meeting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The England squad is growing again in number: the players available to Steve Borthwick have become 41 who will gather starting from Sunday 2 July in Richmond for the start of the first full-ranked meeting given the RWC.</p>
<p>The group of Premiership finalists (Tom Curry, Elliot Daly, Ben Earl, Owen Farrell, George Ford, Jamie George, Jonny Hill, Maro Itoje, Max Malins, Bevan Rodd, and Manu Tuilagi) has completed their mandatory rest period. They will reach the rest of the internationals, as well as French champion Jack Willis.</p>
<p>Other novelties are represented by the call-up of Theo Dan, a 23-year-old hooker for Saracens, and Tom Willis, brother of Jack who played for the entire season in Bordeaux with a modest profit.</p>
<p>There is instead Luke Cowan-Dickie, whose shoulder injury will prevent him from playing in the World Cup. Ollie Chessum, Ollie Lawrence, Mako Vunipola, Billy Vunipola and Jack Walker, on the other hand, are not part of the group of 41 due to injuries, but will be considered for the final selection.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous absence from the group is that of Zach Mercer, number 8 of Montpellier about to return to England, precisely to participate in the RWC. Possibilities that the head coach does not seem inclined to give him.</p>
<p>Borthwick will choose the final 33-man squad on 7 August. Meanwhile, he has already decided to give the ranks of captain, once again, to Owen Farrell.</p>
<p>“I met Owen about ten days ago – Borthwick told the press conference – We spent two hours walking through the meadows outside Harpenden, talking about everything we have in mind for this team. Owen is a fantastic leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis Genge and Courtney Lawes were named vice-captains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Little by little the anxiety for the start of the Tenth Rugby World Cup is gaining ground. On Wednesday, May 31, the countdown to the Kick off of France 2023 was presented in the heart of Paris, the tournament that promises to mark a before and after in the history of the World Cup ovals. The Arc de Triomphe was dyed with Rugby and all of France is looking forward to Friday, September 8, when their selected Les Blues face the All Blacks in the French capital, a dream debut for the organizers.</p>
<p>The numbers that are handled in the account or tickets already sold, the number of people who will attend the tournament, and the effect produced by an event of this magnitude, which is only behind the Soccer World Cup and the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>After passing through South Africa, from the country of the last champions, the Webb Ellis, the precious trophy lifted by champions, arrived in France. The person in charge of escorting the Cup was the South African Tendai Mtawarira, historic forward of the Springboks, champion in Japan 2029.</p>
<p>Not only for fans of rugby but also for sports, to schedule Thursday, September 8 at 4:15 p.m. (Argentine time) in Paris. Firstly, the opening ceremony and then the main course, a duel that has a lot of World Cup history, even both teams starred in two finals, as well as crosses in decisive instances: France vs. New Zealand or Les Blues vs. All Blacks. Not even the organizers imagined that the draw would give them this start to the tournament.</p>
<p>A day later, on Saturday, September 9 in Marseille at 4:00 p.m. (Argentine time), Los Pumas will debut for the third time against England, a team they could never defeat in World Cups, the record is three English wins in the same number of clashes. All in the group stage, on May 27, 199 urban Durban: Argentina 18, England 24; on September 10, 2011, in Dunedin: Argentina 9, England 13 and on October 5, 2019, in Tokyo: Argentina 10, England 39.</p>
<p>The second match that the team led by Australian Michael Cheika will play will be against Samoa on Friday, September 22 at 12:45 pm at the Geoffroy-Guichard Stadium in Saint-Étienne.</p>
<p>The third game of D for Argentina will be against Chile, on Saturday, September 30 at 10 a.m. (Argentine time), at Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes, and in the same stadium but eight days later (Sunday, October 8), Los Pumas will face Japan from 8 (Argentine time).</p>
<h3>Astonishing numbers and data</h3>
<p>Since France 2023, the organizing body for the World Cup together with World Rugby reported shocking figures. Firstly the provision of tournament medals made from recycled phones, collected through the community rugby initiative</p>
<p>It was then confirmed that RWC 2023 is the fastest-ever edition of ticket sales, with almost 2.5 million already sold and some 600,000 fans traveling to enjoy rugby union&#8217;s biggest celebration ever.</p>
<p>French public approval exceeds 90%, with 74% of the host nation&#8217;s population planning to interact with RWC 2023</p>
<p>Plans were unveiled for the stunning Rugby Villages that will provide celebration areas for local and international fans in host cities across France.</p>
<h3>The most popular rugby event in history</h3>
<p>Tournament organizers released the results of the public survey establishing this Rugby World Cup as the most popular and impactful, as rugby fever took hold.</p>
<p>90% of French people support the country as the host state Rugbld Cup, with 76% joining the celebrations in stadiums, Rugby Villages in host cities, or through media and television coverage</p>
<p>More than 600,000 international visitors are expected to join the celebrations in France, a record for a Rugby World Cup</p>
<p>Tickets sold out in record time – all available tickets sold out a year early and France 2023 will break the attendance record for RWC 2015</p>
<p>72% of those who bought tickets will attend with their family, and 45% with friends, underlining the celebration of the union.</p>
