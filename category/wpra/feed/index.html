<p>It was an incredible weekend for the fans at the 72nd Annual PRCA Rodeo in Crossett, Arkansas. The competition saw Rookie Emily Taylor win and get the biggest weekend check for $2495, outrunning her seniors, considering it was her first year.</p>



<p>The thrill of the event left people shocked to see the Cowgirl of Emory, Texas, and her mare Czech as they stopped the clock in 17.67 seconds ahead of 17.96 seconds from Tiany Schuster, who has already qualified for <a href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrangler NFR</a>.</p>



<p>Roding Diva, another mare she finished seventh with a stoppage-time of 15.35 seconds in Mesquite, Texas adding a total of $227. Taylor was excited by her performance and took it to her social Facebook, sounding blissful of her two mares and making new friends.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="800" height="583" src="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emily-Taylor.jpg" alt="Veterans Rookie Emily Taylor Outruns in Crossett" class="wp-image-2108" srcset="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emily-Taylor.jpg 800w, https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emily-Taylor-300x219.jpg 300w, https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emily-Taylor-768x560.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>At the moment, Taylor is at 10th position in the <a href="https://www.wpra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WPRA</a> Rookie Standings due to her astonishing performance over the weekend, despite the muddy conditions.</p>



<p>But she wasn’t the only one having an awesome weekend, because 4th place in the world Jill Wilson had a good time winning the Mesquite Championship Rodeo with a stoppage-time of 15.11 seconds which guaranteed her $968 and $1497 at the Crossett for being in the fourth place with a time of 18.20. The Cowgirl from Texas is after her first Wrangler NFR qualification.</p>



<p>17-time WPRA World Champion JJ Hampton run came to an end following the fast lightening breakaway roping by Brandy Gilbert with a stoppage-time of 1.9 seconds in Mesquite, which edged her with a 2.0-second run.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, other ProRodeo took place in Kadoka, S.D, where Rickie’s Sister, Taylor time of 2.4 seconds, was outrun by both Sawyer Gilbert and Rickie Engesser time of 2.0 seconds tying them to the win. For the Barrel racing in Kadoka, Callahan Tryan won with a 17.72-second run earning $1424, followed by Kelley Wheelhouse with 17.86 seconds and Wrangler NFR qualifier Jessica Routier settling for third place with 17.89 seconds.</p>



<p>Many contenders are preparing themselves for Cowboy Christmas, where they will be required to venture to rodeos unfamiliar to them—crisscrossing the United States for the 2020 edition with 14 rodeos on the schedule throughout Arkansas, Texas, Arizona, Kansas, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota, making it one of the busiest weeks (June 29-July 6) of rodeos this year featuring WPRA Breakaway roping at six of those rodeos. Don’t be left out on the action.</p>
