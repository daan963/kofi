<p>After a year away the cowboys and cowgirls made their return to the <a href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/caldwell-night-rodeo-live-stream/">Caldwell Night Rodeo</a> grounds. Like most events, the pandemic canceled it last year. But, not the outdoor rodeo is back.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is not just a rodeo, it’s not just people coming together this is family,&#8221; Nikki Zachary, Caldwell Night Rodeo President said. &#8220;We are all a big rodeo family here so to miss out last year was devastating and it is fantastic to have it back this year.&#8221;</p>



<p>The team even started planning for this year&#8217;s rodeo the day they had to cancel it last year.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now that it is here it is going to be amazing to see all of our hard work and watching it come to life,&#8221; Zachary said. &#8220;It is exciting. People are emotional, people are excited, they have tears. We are just so happy to have it back.&#8221;</p>



<p>A rodeo, Zachary says is a piece of who she is.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have grown up here my whole life. I missed only one night of the rodeo ever,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is pretty special my mom was two-time president here as well and so I am following in her footsteps.&#8221;</p>



<p>So being here now and being able to have the rodeo again after last year means a lot to Zachary and her family.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can’t even describe it to be honest with you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It has just been something that is second nature to me my whole life, and I used to carry flags here since I was little. I would help do whatever, and then to be stepping in her footsteps is pretty awesome.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also the rodeo&#8217;s first annual First Responders Night.</p>



<p>&#8220;For everything that the first responders have done for our community,&#8221; Zachary said. &#8220;It is near and dear to our hearts especially to me because my husband is a captain here at Caldwell Fire.&#8221;</p>



<p>First responders from all over the Treasure Valley will carry a 20 by 38 foot American Flag out to the arena for the National Anthem.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is going to be very emotional to see that American flag and the beauty of it,&#8221; Zachary said.</p>



<p>The Caldwell Night Rodeo runs through Saturday.</p>



<p>Wednesday night is Man-Up Crusade, and fans are encouraged to wear purple to take a stand against Domestic Violence.</p>

<p>The rodeo in Burwell has been taking place since 1921. It started without any grandstands, now, it’s a festival for the entire region.</p>



<p>We recently talked with Teresa Seidell, a rodeo spokesperson, about the event.</p>



<p>“The rodeo is July 28 through the 31 this year,” Seidell said. “Saturday night will be the big night.”</p>



<p>Turns out, the rodeo started small.</p>



<p>“There were no grandstands, it was just the rough dirt, and they didn’t even till up the soil,” Seidell said. “Back then, they had makeshift chutes, so when the rough stock bucked out, the riders landed on the dirt, so it was a hard landing for the riders. Today, our standards are that we work up the soil, and there is a nice bed for the horses and bucking stock to use.”</p>

<p>When you go to the rodeo in Burwell, you are going to feel like you’ve stepped back in time.</p>



<p>“That is what we are going for,” Seidell said. “Not the old-fashioned, but the traditional.”</p>



<p>The Burwell rodeo offers a number of unique features. For example, there is a track around the arena that allows for more entertainment.</p>



<p>“We have the wild horse race that everybody talks about,” Seidell said. “So between each PRCA event, we have an event on the track. The sky boxes and the crow’s nest were all constructed in 2010.”</p>



<p>The rodeo draws different reactions from different competitors.</p>



<p>“They are often surprised by the vastness of the arena,” Seidell said. “We have a really large arena, and many people are overwhelmed by that. Some contestants like it, some do not. The atmosphere here for everyone is uplifting. Everybody is excited to be here, and everyone is excited to have a celebration. Our town is excited to have a celebration. Half of the people will be from out of town, and the other half will be local people that just come out every night for the rodeo. It’s a festival for our town. We have the Calamus Lake, and that brings in a different clientele of people, but they all come in.”</p>



<p>The Burwell Rodeo is celebrating a “Century of Tradition” this year. Be sure to check it out!</p>

<p>The Calgary Stampede’s Nashville North will become one of the first major events in Canada to require proof of vaccination, or a COVID-19 rapid test in order to attend.</p>



<p>“Ensuring the safety of <a href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/calgary-stampede-live-stream/">Calgary Stampede</a> participants is a top priority. To this end, 19 To Zero will be partnering with the Calgary Stampede to implement a proof of vaccination/rapid testing program for all who visit Nashville North. This is in addition to work both organizations have done in collaboration to promote vaccine uptake which is the single best protection against COVID-19,” Says Dr. Jia Hu, partner of 19 to Zero and Calgary Stampede advisor.</p>



<p>Verification methods include a physical copy or photo of a vaccination record or Alberta Health MyHealth mobile app. Rapid testing will also be available onsite for those unable, or, for some reason, unwilling to be vaccinated.</p>



<p>As well, the Stampede is implementing additional safety measures designed to stem the potential spread of infectious pathogens, including transitioning from full tents to open-sided canopies, and the addition of digital qeueing, removing the need to physically stand in line.</p>



<p>“Digital queuing prevents the need to physically stand in line. You can head out and enjoy everything else Stampede Park has to offer,” says Laurendeau, adding, “When it’s your turn to enter, you will receive a notification. It’s just that easy.”</p>



<p>The annual ten day rodeo, one of the world’s largest, includes parades, a midway, stage shows, concerts, agricultural competitions, chuckwagon racing, and First Nations exhibitions.</p>



<p>Performers announced for 2021 include Terri Clark and High Valley.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to see live music return to our city for Stampede 2021. As we join the communities around the world that are returning to live entertainment events, this simple process provides an extra level of comfort specifically for Nashville North,” says the Calgary Stampede’s Vice President responsible for programming and operations, Jim Laurendeau “It is just one of many safety protocols and aligned with our commitment to meet and exceed all public health guidelines.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At just 26 years old, bull rider <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/sage-kimzey/71715">Sage Kimzey</a> has nothing left to prove in the rodeo business. He&#8217;s earned six PRCA world championships in seven trips to the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, won the average there three times and has more than $2.5 million in career earnings.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t for one second believe that means Kimzey is done striving to be the best.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing to prove to anyone at this point, except to prove to myself what I am capable of,&#8221; Kimzey said. </p>
<p>&#8220;I push to see what I can put my body through, how much I can take and continue to compete at the highest level.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s still chasing his stated goal of breaking Don Gay&#8217;s record for PRCA bull riding world championships which stands at eight. </p>
<p>With just three months left in the 2021 season, Kimzey is in familiar territory, leading the RAM | PRCA World Standings once again. He added to his lead during the Dinosaur Roundup Rodeo in Vernal, Utah, July 10 after sharing the win with <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/parker-mccown/97783">Parker McCown</a> with matching 90.5-point rides.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it was Kimzey&#8217;s first win in Vernal, a stop on the Pro Rodeo Tour.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been there a few times; it seems like we get there about every other year or so, but I&#8217;ve never gotten much done,&#8221; said Kimzey, who made his ride on July 9. &#8220;It was good to break the ice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Oklahoma native, who now makes his home in Salado, Texas, knew he had a chance to change that streak when he saw he&#8217;d drawn Audacious from Powder River Rodeo.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a really nice bull; he&#8217;s been the money bull for Powder River and D&amp;H for several years now, but he&#8217;s actually been even better this year than the last couple of years,&#8221; Kimzey said. </p>
<p>Kimzey first rode the bull to the pay window during the 2019 San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo. Last week in Belle Fourche, S.D., <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/daylon-swearingen/96454">Daylon Swearingen</a> had a 90-point ride on Audacious for the win.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the one you want to draw so I was really happy,&#8221; Kimzey said. &#8220;It was good to capitalize on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kimzey banked another $3,038 towards the world standings and picked up more valuable Pro Rodeo Tour points, working towards a qualification to the Pro Rodeo Tour Finale to be held in Salinas, Calif., on the final weekend of the regular season in September. Kimzey is second in the Tour.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tour rodeos are the biggest and richest rodeos, so the Tour standings and the world standings go hand-in-hand,&#8221; Kimzey said. &#8220;It will be cool to go out to Salinas for the Finale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite a torrid schedule in 2021 – Kimzey has already attempted 80 bulls, riding an impressive 62% of them – the champ is feeling ready to tackle the heart of the rodeo season for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m healthy. All is well and I&#8217;ve got no complaints,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Other winners at the $151,292  rodeo were all-around cowboy <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/stetson-wright/96898">Stetson Wright</a> ($1,962, saddle bronc riding and bull riding); bareback rider <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/tilden-hooper/21197">Tilden Hooper</a> (88 points on Powder River Rodeo&#8217;s 99 Problems); steer wrestler <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/shane-frey/59956">Shane Frey</a> (3.6 seconds); team ropers <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/clay-smith/70769">Clay Smith</a>/<a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/jade-corkill/20599">Jade Corkill</a> and <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/dustin-egusquiza/93020">Dustin Egusquiza</a>/<a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/travis-graves/18721">Travis Graves</a> (4.5 seconds each); saddle bronc rider <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/jesse-wright/52842">Jesse Wright</a> (91.5 points on Powder River Rodeo&#8217;s Bet The Ranch); tie down roper <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/tuf-cooper/21910">Tuf Cooper</a> (7.5 seconds) and barrel racer <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/emily-miller-beisel/74769">Emily Miller-Beisel</a> (17.08 seconds).</p>

<p>Despite the earlier cancelation of the Rodeos in mid-march due to the COVID-19 pandemic and gladly resuming in May&#8217;s third week. The 27th Annual Southeastern Pro Rodeo is here to thrill the fans once again as the Pro riders give their all in the field to prove who is the best.</p>



<p>Surely, don&#8217;t miss out on the action which will go on for a two-day streak of electrifying performance on July 24 and 25. A Pro-circuit competition, this Rodeo is a showcase of the saddle and bareback bronc riding, tie-down roping, steer wrestling, barrel racing, team roping, and bull riding.</p>
