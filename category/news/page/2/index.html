<p class="dm_article-chapeau"><strong>The Rugby World Cup going to start from September 8 to October 28. To better understand the subtleties of this sport with often complex rules, we offer you a simplified summary of them, to know the basics.</strong></p>
<h2 class="dm_article-paragraph-title">Backward Passes</h2>
<p>The first peculiarity of??rugby??is that players are forbidden to pass the ball in hand forward. They must therefore do so only to a partner located behind them, or on the same line. If the referee believes that the ball has moved to the front of the passer, he will whistle a foul, called &#8220;forward&#8221;. Ditto if a player drops it by clumsiness in front of him.</p>
<h2 class="dm_article-paragraph-title">The Melee</h2>
<p>Symbol of rugby, the scrum brings together the eight &#8220;forwards&#8221; of each <a href="../../../../teams/index.html">team</a> (the strongest players, whose number is between 1 and 8). Both packs must push to gain possession of the ball, which is introduced in the middle of the scrum. In the majority of cases, a scrum is whistled when one of the teams has committed a &#8220;forward&#8221;.</p>
<h2 class="dm_article-paragraph-title">The Key</h2>
<p>In rugby, the touch takes longer and mobilizes more players than in other sports. As with the scrum, they concern the &#8220;forwards&#8221; of each team, even if they are not all obliged to be present (the team that got the key decides the number). Each team organizes itself in line (called &#8220;the lineup&#8221;) and must make sure to lift one of the players (with the help of two teammates) so that he retrieves the ball, sent in the air.</p>
<h2 class="dm_article-paragraph-title">Tackling</h2>
<p>Another peculiarity of rugby, the players in defense must stop the opposing attacker (the one who carries the ball) by making him fall to the ground. This is called a tackle. The goal is to grab the opponent with his arms and impact with the shoulder, to unbalance him. The tackle must be made between the ankles and shoulders. If it is too high, the referee whistles a foul and often distributes a card (yellow or red, depending on the severity). Similarly, it is forbidden to grab an opponent, make him take his feet off the ground, and turn him over to make him fall back (cathedral tackle). In this case, the expulsion is immediate.</p>
<h2 class="dm_article-paragraph-title">The Ruck</h2>
<p>When a player is tackled, he finds himself on the ground with his opponent. It is then enough for another player to intervene to try to take the ball or protect it (depending on his side) for a ruck to be reported. The game is not interrupted and both teams can compete for the ball without making a mistake (being on your knees, arriving on one side, being in the opposing camp&#8230;). This match situation, very frequently, is often the most complicated to understand because the players are entangled and give free rein to many interpretations of the rules.</p>
<h2 class="dm_article-paragraph-title">Offside</h2>
<p>Offside is the most common foul in rugby, as the possibilities of being caught by the referee are numerous. At each ruck, for example, the players in defense (who do not play the ball) must necessarily place themselves behind a fictitious line, symbolized by the feet of the last participant in the grouping. In the current game, the offside line no longer exists, unless a player is in front of a partner of the same team when the latter kicks the ball. In this case, the player placed in front must not make any play action until his teammate has overtaken him, under the penalty of being sanctioned.</p>
<h2 class="dm_article-paragraph-title">The Game at The Foot</h2>
<p>If rugby is a sport that is played with the hands, the use of the foot is not prohibited. On the contrary, it is even an important weapon for teams, to allow the ball to be sent back as far as possible in the opposing camp, or to surprise the defense. In the latter case, the players will make a small kick (see the gif, below) to try to recover the ball, or a??candle (ball very high in the sky), to put pressure on the opposing team.</p>
<p>But most often, the footwork is used to occupy the field. It is then possible to choose to leave the ball in the playing area or to make it come out in touch, to break an action. A peculiarity of rugby is that in the latter case, the ball must touch the ground in the field before leaving in touch, for it to be valid. An exception exists, however, in the case where the player has shot from the area of the 22 meters closest to his goal, materialized by a white line on the ground.</p>
<h2 class="dm_article-paragraph-title">The Different Ways to Score Points</h2>
<p>In rugby, there are many ways to score points, and they don&#8217;t earn the same number. When a player crosses the opposing goal line and manages to flatten the ball to the ground, he scores a try. This one is worth five points and then allows you to type a transformation. It is then necessary that the striker of the team puts the ball by positioning himself in front of the posts but remaining on the line where he has been flattened. It is then up to him to kick him between the poles (see the gif, below). If he succeeds, he adds two points for his own.</p>
<p>It is also possible for a team to score a penalty try. This is a decision of the referee, who considers that the defenders committed a foul that prevented their opponents from scoring a try. The penalty try is worth seven points upfront, as there is no need to convert it.</p>
<p>It is also possible to score points without the need to cross the opponent&#8217;s goal line. When the referee whistles a penalty against a team, his opponent then has the opportunity to try to score three points, by hitting the ball between the posts, like the transformation. When a defense is very well organized, sometimes that&#8217;s the only way to score.</p>
<p>You can also score three points by making a drop, which consists, in the current game, of a player kicking the ball, having bounced it just at the time of the strike. If, as for the conversion or penalty, the ball passes between the opposing posts, the points are validated.</p>

<h2><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">The teams present</span></h2>
<p>A total of 20 nations will compete for the Webb Ellis Trophy. We logically find the host country, France, as well as England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Portugal, Georgia, Wales, New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Japan, Namibia, South Africa, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.</p>
<h2>They can win the competition.</h2>
<p>Among them, some leave with more certainty than others. Among the favorites, we find New Zealand, given the winner by the British bookmakers ahead of France, South Africa, and Ireland. They are simply the four best nations on the planet if we refer to the World Rugby rankings. Carried by its public and led by a golden generation, France is the most awaited <a href="../../../../teams/index.html">team</a> in this tournament. She will have to face New Zealand as always, third in 2019 and more vengeful than ever. It will logically be necessary to count on South Africa, the defending champion, and Ireland, which achieved the Grand Slam at the last VI Nations Tournament.</p>
<h2>The underdog teams</h2>
<p>It won&#8217;t be easy to create a surprise this year, but you never know what sport has in store for you. Behind the four huge favorites stands a list of as many outsiders. The unfortunate finalist of the last edition, England arrives much less well-armed than four years ago but remains a leading nation of the oval ball, in the same way as Australia. The <cite>Wallabies</cite> are going through a difficult period, but they are coached by the very experienced Eddie Jones, a two-time World Cup finalist (2003 with Australia and 2019 with England ). Narrowly beaten in preparation against South Africa, Argentina could also cause problems for the nations supposedly stronger on paper. Finally, Scotland could also have a say. The XV du Chardon has recently given the XV of France a hard time.</p>
<h2>The top players present at the 2023 Rugby World Cup</h2>
<p>What would a World Cup be without its host of stars? The best players on the planet will be there in France. The Blues captain<cite>, </cite>Antoine Dupont, will be there, as well as Gr??gory Alldritt or Thomas Ramos. New Zealand can count on Ardie Savea or Beauden Barrett, twice voted the best player in the world. A distinction currently held by the Irish third-line Josh Van Der Flier, who will try to lead the XV of Clover to the world title just like the indestructible Jonathan Sexton. England will undoubtedly rely on their star Mauro Itoje during a crisis as their fly-half Owen Farrell will miss the first two meetings. For South Africa, Cheslin Kolbe and captain Siya Kolisi will be there to try to defend their title. Voted the best player in the world in 2019, Pieter-Steph du Toit was also called up by Jacques Nienaber. Very fit lately, the Scots Finn Russell and Duhan van der Merwe will tread the lawns of the hexagon just like the Italian Ange Capuozzowhich could reveal itself to the general public.</p>
<h2>The main absentees from the 2023 Rugby World Cup</h2>

October 28). The second on French soil after that of 2007. It&#8217;s a World Cup that promises to be particularly unpredictable, given the number of <a href="../../../../teams/index.html">teams</a> able to go all the Way. Crowned with the status of organizing country, France expected. Since taking office as coach of the XV of France after the 2019 World Cup, Fabien Galthi?? has built a group capable of offering French rugby its first star. Despite Romain Ntamack&#8217;s package, the Blues are not lacking in talent. Brought in the wake of Antoine Dupont at the top of his game, France is the favorite in this tournament. But beware, the XV of France has no margin over its rivals.??</span></p>
<p><strong>All-Time Favorites Teams:??</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NEW ZEALAND</li>
<li>FRANCE</li>
<li>SOUTH AFRICA</li>
<li>IRELAND</li>
<li>ENGLAND</li>
<li>AUSTRALIA</li>
</ul>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Is New Zealand on the Way to a 4th World Cup title?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In particular, New Zealand is present in the Poule and will act as the first opponent for the XV of France. Set back in recent years, and the All-Blacks intend to regain their usual standard by offering themselves a fourth Webb Ellis Cup to their credit. In addition to New Zealand, Ireland will play their Way. Winner of the Six Nations Tournament this year, the Green Army, sure of its rugby, hopes this time to break the Indian sign of the quarter-finals???a stage of the competition that the XV of Clover has never crossed in seven attempts.??</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For that, the squad led by Andy Farrell will have to hope for a great Johnny Sexton. The Irish opener almost missed the start of the World Cup due to his &#8220;bad behavior&#8221; on the sidelines of the Champions Cup final between La Rochelle and Leinster at the end of May (27-26). But the EPCR, lenient on this issue, finally sanctioned the 38-year-old player with a three-game suspension (served during the preparation of Ireland). Before potentially crossing paths with Fabien Galthi??&#8217;s men in the quarter-finals, Ireland will face South Africa. Reigning world champions after his coronation in Japan in 2019, the Springboks will have a card to play in this World Cup.??</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SOUTH AFRICA FOR A DOUBLE, AUSTRALIA AND ENGLAND IN DECLINE</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Large winner of Wales (56-16), last Saturday in Cardiff, South Africa made a fine demonstration of its strength. The only downside for coach Jacques Nienaber is the presence or absence of Handr?? Pollard. Injured in the calf since May, the 29-year-old opening half was not selected to participate in the competition and was registered as a reserve. But his physical condition seems to be improving???something to give hope to his coach. &#8220;Handr?? is almost in great shape; he just needs to do more physical work. He is in the return to the game phase. He is probably a week away from being ready to play, but he will still need to get back into shape,&#8221; he said in remarks reported by our colleagues from Rugbynist??re. Good news for South African supporters,??</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to these four big favorites, the injured beasts, England, Australia, and Wales, will be noticed. Despite their takeover by Eddie Jones, the Wallabies have been struggling to string together convincing results for several years and seem to be in sharp decline compared to international leaders. But, in the world, everything seems possible. This is also what we wish for England. Defeated by Ireland (29-10) last Saturday at the Aviva Stadium, the XV of the Rose could see the long Way to go to regain its standing. Finally, Wales will be noticed. Before thinking about the quarter-finals, the Welsh will have to extricate themselves from a Pool C made up of Portugal, Georgia, Australia, and Fiji. Pacific players dream of bringing down the Leek XV on September 10 at the Matmut Atlantique in Bordeaux to reach the quarter-finals.</span></p>

<p>Ticking, ticking. With just over three weeks to go until the start of the Rugby World Cup in France, the second after the 2007 World Cup, the 20 nations that secured their <a href="../../../../rugby-world-cup-2023-where-to-buy-tickets/index.html">ticket</a> to the event are fine-tuning the preparations. Among the qualified <a href="../../../../teams/index.html">teams</a>, there are regulars such as the XV of France (host country), New Zealand but also Australia and England. Ditto for South Africa, still qualified for the World Cup since its first participation in 1995) and Argentina. The British nations will not be left out with the presence of Scotland, Wales, or Ireland.</p>
<h2>FIRST PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD CUP FOR CHILE</h2>
<p>We will also note the presence of Samoa, Fiji, and Tonga. Japan will want to confirm its excellent performance on home soil in the last edition. Proof of this is the evolution of world rugby; we note the first participation of Chile. Another South American nation present in France for the World Cup, Uruguay. The Celestial will chain a second consecutive World Cup after 2015, the fourth in total. Never qualified for the quarter-finals of this competition, Italy hopes to finally live the big night in France at the expense of the host country or the Blacks. Georgia will experience the same thing. Absent from the last edition, Romania will try to pick up points despite an aging group struggling to renew itself. A victory will also be Namibia&#8217;s goal, another great competition regular. Finally, how can we forget Portugal, whose staff has been strengthened with Frenchman David G??rard&#8217;s arrival at the event?</p>
<h2>THE QUALIFIERS FOR THE WORLD CUP BY CONTINENT</h2>

<h2>RUGBY WORLD CUP 2023 PREDICTION: PRESENTATION OF THE COMPETITION</h2>
<p>France has been entrusted with organizing the 10th World Cup from September 8 to October 28, 2023, with 20 teams from 5 continents who will compete for the supreme title.</p>
<p>The twenty nations were divided into 4 groups of 5 teams nationwide. 9 French cities (Paris, Lille, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille, Lyon, Saint-??tienne, and Nice) will host the 48 matches of the competition in September and October. The top two nations in each group will advance to the quarterfinals, followed by the semi-finals and final on Saturday, October 28, at the Stade de France.</p>
<p>4 teams seem to be above this year, with New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, and the XV of France, with an outcome that we hope is happy for our Blues!</p>
<h2>RUGBY WORLD PREDICTION 2023: WHO WILL BE CROWNED WORLD CHAMPION?</h2>
<p>At every Rugby World Cup, New Zealand is the favorite. But this year, bookmakers do not hesitate to put the XV of France at the same height as the triple world champions. They were closely followed by the reigning world champions, South Africa, and the winners of the last 6 Nations tournament the previous spring, Ireland, which has never been stronger. Behind, England and Australia are a notch below this year, but be careful not to underestimate them.</p>
<h3>2023 WORLD CUP PREDICTION: THE ODDS OF THE FUTURE WINNER</h3>
<ul>
<li>France: Rating of 3.75</li>
<li>New Zealand: rating of 3.75</li>
<li>South Africa: odds of 5.50</li>
<li>Ireland: odds of 5.50</li>
<li>England: odds of 12.00</li>
<li>Australia: odds of 12.00</li>
<li>Argentina: odds of 30.00</li>
<li>Wales: odds of 35.00</li>
<li>Scotland: odds of 50.00</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The odds have been taken on the <a href="../../../../index.html">Rwcupdates</a> website and can change up to a few minutes before the start of the competition.</em></p>
<h2>OUR GROUP A PREDICTION: FRANCE ??? NEW ZEALAND ??? ITALY ??? NAMIBIA ??? URUGUAY</h2>
<p>The two main favorites of this Rugby World Cup 2023, France and New Zealand, are in the same group during this group stage. And precisely, these two teams will face each other in the opening match on September 8 at the Stade de France. And this meeting will determine 99% of the winner of this group.</p>
<p>And in a context where tension will be present, our rugby prediction will bet on the success of the All-Blacks against the French, who could be tense and stressed by the event. A lot of expectations around the XV of France could add extra pressure, and when it comes to facing the most impressive team on the planet, it could make a difference. Even if Antoine Dupont&#8217;s partners lose this match and finish only second, the impact would be limited since, in the quarterfinals, it will be either South Africa or Ireland, that is to say, the other favorites of the tournament???an advantage for New Zealand in group A of the Rugby World Cup.</p>
<p><strong>Rugby World Cup prediction Group A: New Zealand group winners (odds of 1.90)</strong></p>
<h2>OUR PREDICTION GROUP B: SOUTH AFRICA ??? IRELAND ??? SCOTLAND ??? TONGA ??? ROMANIA</h2>
<p>This Group B will be the group of death of this World Cup with the Boks, the Irish, and the Scots, with only two places for the quarterfinals. A team will be left out after the 4 games where each victory will be worth its weight of gold.</p>
<p>And if the fight is fierce, especially between the Boks and the Irish, our rugby prediction will bet on a victory of the XV of the Clover in this group B. Jonathan Sexton&#8217;s partners have been impressive for 3 seasons now, and the Grand Slam was achieved last spring and confirmed the tour won the previous year with the Blacks. If the duel against the reigning world champions will be of rare intensity, playing in Europe with a stadium that will be green will give a significant advantage to finish in first place in Group B.</p>
<p><strong>Rugby World Cup prediction Group B: Ireland group winners (odds of 2.00)</strong></p>
<h2>OUR PREDICTION GROUP C: AUSTRALIA ??? WALES ??? FIJI ??? GEORGIA ??? PORTUGAL</h2>
<p>This group C will probably be the weakest in this world, where the Australians and the Welsh should fight for the first place unless the Fijians manage to create a feat.</p>
<p>The Wallabies remain on a failed Rugby Championship with 3 defeats in as many games, despite the assumption of office of Eddy Jones, who had come to the rescue after an autumn tour also catastrophic. The Welsh, on their side, are also in a slack period, with two last tournaments of the 6 Nations failing. But in a generational low, the Leek XV will have a hard time preventing the Australians from finishing in the first place, the Wallabies, who have a more extensive but also more talented squad.</p>
<p><strong>Rugby World Cup prediction Group C: Australia group winner (odds of 1.30)</strong></p>
<h2>OUR PREDICTION GROUP D: ENGLAND ??? ARGENTINA ??? JAPAN ??? SAMOA ??? CHILE</h2>
<p>4 years ago, Argentina and England were in the same group for this Rugby World Cup 2023. And if in Japan, the Argentines had bitten the dust and had not passed the first round, it should be better in France this year, with the XV de la Rose as its primary opponent.</p>
<p>If the English come out of a problematic 6 Nations tournament, the experience of Steve Borthwick&#8217;s men should be able to make the difference against the Pumas. Owen Farrell and his teammates have learned a lot from their defeat against his same Argentines in a test match last autumn, and Michael Cheika&#8217;s men could this time suffer the strength of the English pack.</p>
<p><strong>Rugby World Cup prediction Group D: England group winners (odds of 1.40)</strong></p>
<h2>RUGBY WORLD CUP 2023 PREDICTION: THE PLAYERS TO FOLLOW TO WIN!</h2>
<p>All competitions are full of stars who could make you win big at this Rugby World Cup. These try markers will be followed throughout the competition and all the matches they participate in.</p>
<p>Honor to the France winger Damian Penaud who could be one of the stars of this world. The new UBB player will have the opportunity to shine during the matches of the XV of France, and making your rugby prediction on this player could bring you a lot of earnings during the 6 weeks of competition. On the side of the XV of Ireland, James Lowe will also have the opportunity to talk about him during this Rugby World Cup 2023. The Leinster winger has all the qualities of the modern winger with power and speed. The Clover XV will need their home try scorer to aim for the supreme title, and there is no doubt that James Lowe will be there. Another player to watch during this Rugby World Cup is Mark Telea. Super Rugby&#8217;s top scorer, the All-Black, discovered the selection a few months ago, and his impact is already there with a try at the last Rugby Championship. These 3 players will be followed closely during the competition, with exciting odds during each appearance!</p>

Up to 600,000 visitors are expected in the country. In addition, around 17,000 jobs are expected to be preserved.</p>
<p><strong>The Rugby World Cup, which will be played in France between September 8 and October 28 of this year, will earn the European country ???800 million,</strong>??with almost 50% of the income from ticket sales.</p>
<p>The president of the GIP (Public Interest Group) France 2023, Jacques Rivoal, said:??<i><strong>&#8220;The World Cup will be profitable. The financial result is certain and our reference is the 2015 World Cup in England, where the contexts were quite similar. , or even that of 2007 when it was also organized in France&#8221;.</strong></i></p>
<p>A World Cup is also a boost to the local economy.??In fact, up to 600,000 foreign visitors??across the country??<strong>are expected to follow the 48 matches of the competition in the nine stadiums that will host the tournament.</strong></p>
<p>But not everyone will attend the matches, so the &#8220;Rugby Villages&#8221;, fan zones, bars and restaurants, and hotels, will benefit from the event during a summer season that will last until October, said <i>Rugbyrama</i>.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>17,000 jobs should be supported or preserved thanks to the event</strong>.??A range of around ???400 million is mentioned in spending for the organization of the World Cup.??Two-thirds are reserved for the organization of the event, the rest will be donated to World Rugby.</p>
<p><strong>The World Cup will begin at the Stade de France with the opening match between France and New Zealand</strong>.??Les Bleus are among the favourites for the supreme title, which would be the first for French rugby union since the first World Cup in 1987.</p>

<p>Gone are the candidacies of Ireland and South Africa. The 2023 Rugby World Cup will be hosted by France and will take place in the second part of the year: from September 8 to October 28.</p>
<p>The locals will share Group A together with New Zealand, a known Six Nations such as Italy, Uruguay and the classic African participant: Namibia. At the Stade de France, Les Bleus against the All Blacks will kick off.</p>
<p>In Group B will be the defending champions, the Springboks, alongside the Clover XV, Tonga, Romania and Scotland. Three Europeans are part of this zone, an instance in which the first two pass and then the best third of each one.</p>
<p>Wales and Australia, rivals and already a World Cup classic at this point, will be fighting side by side to advance to the next round from Group C, which has them with Fiji, Georgia and Portugal, which comes from the playoffs.</p>
<p>Finally, England and Argentina command Group D, one in which they are with the rookie Chile, with ever-present Samoa and with Japan, which continues with its dream of being part of the Big 10, or the Big 11 if they are included.</p>
<p>As mentioned, South Africa starts defending the title and therefore is one of the favourites, since it is one of the two three-time champion teams. The others who have achieved this are the All Blacks. Europe is looking for its second title since the only one from the Northern Hemisphere that won was England in 2003.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Rugby World Cup 2023 will begin with France taking on New Zealand in an opening encounter with all the makings of a classic in less than ten months.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although the match between Les Bleus and the three-time champions should kick off the tournament in the greatest possible way, other games on the calendar have captured our attention.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Os Lobos will play their first Rugby World Cup match in 16 years when they take on Wales in Nice on September 16, 2023, thanks to <a href="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/2023/news/777609/rwc-2023-qualifier-spotlight-portugal">Portugal&#8217;s</a> last-minute victory over Wales for the 20th and last spot in France 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The two European nations have only twice faced off in a test match, with Wales winning the first encounter 102-11 in Lisbon in 1994.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We pick seven games from the pool stage that could significantly affect how the competition plays out.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">New Zealand vs France in Pool A on September 8 Sporting France</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Rugby World Cup 2023 will get underway with a bang when the hosts square off against the <a href="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/2023/news/608461/rwc-2023-spotlight-new-zealand">All Blacks</a> in the first game at the Stade de France. The two nations have played against each other seven times in Rugby World Cup, giving them a plethora of combined tournament experience.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The teams initially faced off in the RWC final at Eden Park in 1987, which New Zealand won 29-9. The two nations later met again for the RWC 2011 championship game, which the All Blacks won 8-7. But, undoubtedly, the most thrilling match between the teams was in the RWC 1999 semi-finals when Les Bleus rallied a 24-10 lead to win 43-31 at Twickenham</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The two sides will only be faced once before, during the pool stage, in the RWC 2023 opener. This match will be significant in determining who wins Pool A because there are still games against Italy, Uruguay, and Namibia.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pool D, September 17, Stade de Nice, England vs. Japan</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">England will play Japan in Nice in their second Pool D encounter, which coach Eddie Jones has undoubtedly highlighted on the team&#8217;s schedule. At RWC 2015, Jones guided the Brave Blossoms to three victories, including the &#8220;Brighton Miracle&#8221; victory over <a href="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/2023/news/608463/rwc-2023-spotlight-south-africa">South Africa</a>. He contributed to the team&#8217;s emergence as a significant player on the world stage.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His replacement Jamie Joseph has sustained that growth and Japan will be confident they have the talent to advance from their Pool for the second straight Rugby World Cup. However, should England defeat Argentina in their opening match in France 2023, Jones&#8217; team would have the chance to all but guarantee their advancement, with games against Samoa and Chile coming after this one?</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The two countries have only ever faced off in a Rugby World Cup match, which England won 60-7 in Sydney in the 1987 tournament&#8217;s pool stage. Since then, they have only met twice at Twickenham, where the hosts have won both times, 35-15 in 2018 and 52-13 earlier this month.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ireland vs South Africa, Pool B, September 23 Sporting France</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Current champions Whatever the outcome in Marseille, a lot will depend on the Springboks&#8217; match against Ireland 13 days later. South Africa faces Scotland in their opening match of the RWC 2023. The games involving the three teams will be critical because all three will have goals beyond the pool stage.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ireland has never faced South Africa at a Rugby World Cup, so this encounter at Stade de France will be a leap into the unknown for both teams. Although Ireland has won the previous two tests, the Springboks have the advantage in this matchup after winning 18 of the 27 matches between the groups.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The victors may have an advantage in the competition to win Pool B if they win on the outskirts of Paris. However, Ireland will be aware that, given their scheduled match against Scotland on the penultimate weekend of the pool stage, their fate for the RWC 2023 should still be in their own hands regardless of the outcome against South Africa.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Australia vs Wales, Pool C, Parc OL, September 24</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the third Sunday of the competition, Lyon will play host to one of the most frequent Rugby World Cup matches in recent memory. At four of the previous five Rugby World Cups, including France 2023, Wales and Australia were assigned to the same Pool, and they also competed against one another in the bronze medal game of New Zealand 2011.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/2023/news/607220/rwc-2023-spotlight-australia">Australia</a> won the Pool after defeating Wales in Cardiff in 2007 and Twickenham in 2015, and the Wallabies also prevailed in the RWC 2011 bronze match. Wales defeated Australia at Tokyo Stadium to win Pool D of the 2019 RWC, breaking their losing streak in the competition.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Regardless of who prevails in this most recent matchup in Lyon, they will control Pool C, but neither team can afford to ignore the threat offered by Fiji, Georgia, or Portugal. The Fijians beat Wales to a spot in the quarterfinals 15 years ago and were drawn in the same Pool as Australia and Wales in 2007, 2015, 2019, and now 2023.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pool D, September 30, Stade de la Beaujoire, Argentina vs. Chile</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The attention of the team and their supporters would have been drawn to their assignment in Nantes when Chile won their historic qualifying for the Rugby World Cup 2023. With it, their spot in Pool D. On September 10 in Toulouse, Los C??ndores will compete in their first-ever Rugby World Cup game against Japan. Chile will also have played Samoa and England before they arrive at Stade de la Beaujoire at the end of the month.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the meeting with their South American neighbors will have sent hearts racing. Since 1936, Chile has faced Argentina on 39 occasions but has never defeated Los Pumas.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Will that alter the most critical stage for the men&#8217;s game? Chile will hope that after beating the odds to qualify for their first Rugby World Cup, they can break even more records once they arrive in France. On the other hand, Argentina will be aware that a win in Nantes is essential if they advance to the quarterfinals.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pool C, October 7, Stade de la Beaujoire, Wales vs. Georgia</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Georgia has participated in five tournaments but has never advanced past the quarterfinals. The Lelos have only triumphed in five of their 20 Rugby World Cup games, but they have made progress, and their hopes of advancing past the pool stage in France were raised by their historic victory over Wales last weekend in Cardiff.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before the meeting at Principality Stadium, Georgia had lost their previous three encounters with Wales. In that stretch, the teams lost their lone tournament encounter by a score of 43???14 at RWC 2019. All of that was altered by a late Luka Matkava penalty in Cardiff, which gave the Lelos a well-earned 13-12 victory and gave the team hope they could accomplish something remarkable in France.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The clubs will next face off in Nantes for the conclusion of Pool C, and both will be hoping to arrive at Stade de la Beaujoire still running for a spot in the quarterfinals. Even while Wales would still be the odds-on favorite to win the game, the players will still be thinking about what happened in Cardiff.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Argentina vs. Japan, Pool D, October 8 at Stade de la Beaujoire</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Argentina watched as England and France advanced from Pool C while Japan became the first Asian team to play in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals. Hosts Although neither the Brave Blossoms nor Los Pumas will want to leave it that late in France, Japan secured their spot in the round of eight with an outstanding victory over Scotland in their final Pool A match.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although it seems likely that qualification will still be on the line for at least one of the sides when they meet in Nantes on the final day of pool play, given that England, Samoa, and <a href="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/2023/news/733130/rwc-2023-spotlight-chile">Chile</a> are also in Pool D at RWC 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There has only ever been one Rugby World Cup match between Argentina and Japan. During the RWC 1999 match in Cardiff, tries from Agustin Pichot and Diego Albanese helped the Argentines win 33-12. Former Los Pumas coach Mario Ladesma was lined up as the hooker. With the win, Los Pumas beat Ireland 28-24 in Lens to advance to the quarterfinal playoffs.</span></p>
