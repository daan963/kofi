<p>Steer wrestler <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/tanner-brunner/71182" rel="smarttag" rev="71182">Tanner Brunner&#8217;s</a> 2021 season has not gone according to plan.<br /><br />The Ramona, Kan., cowboy who qualified for the last three National Finals Rodeos is making a frantic push to keep his NFR streak alive.<br /><br />Brunner, who entered the weekend 30th in the PRCA | RAM World Standings, helped his cause by winning the Kitsap Stampede with a 3.6-second run Friday in Bremerton, Wash.<br /><br />The rodeo was part of the ProRodeo Tour presented by Pendleton Whisky.<br /><br />&#8220;I had no idea I won,&#8221; said Brunner, who found out he&#8217;d won when ProRodeo.com called him late Friday night while he was sitting on a plane in Minneapolis. &#8220;It feels great to get this win. I needed the Tour points and I need to keep pushing this late in the year.&#8221;<br /><br />Brunner made his run in Bremerton in slack Friday morning and earned $4,090.<br /><br />&#8220;I knew I had a chance, and I just had to score a little bit and use what I drew,&#8221; Brunner said. &#8220;I was riding my horse Miss Kitty, and J.D. Struxness was hazing for me. I know I&#8217;m kind of a long shot to qualify for the NFR so every win I get certainly helps. I don&#8217;t even know if I had ever placed in Bremerton before Friday, so this feels good.&#8221;<br /><br />Considering he has a good chunk of ground to make up in the world standings in a short period of time, Brunner would love to qualify for the ProRodeo Tour Finale, which will pay $1 million to contestants and other PRCA members at California Rodeo Salinas, Sept. 23-26.<br /><br />&#8220;I need to keep picking up those Tour points so I can get to the ProRodeo Tour Finale and give myself a chance,&#8221; said Brunner, 28.<br /><br />Up next for Brunner is Rapid City, S.D., Saturday morning in slack.<br /><br />&#8220;The rest of my crew was out in Coeur d&#8217;Alene, Idaho, (Friday night) and they dropped me off on the side of the interstate, and I got an Uber headed toward the Seattle airport and they kept on trucking to Coeur d&#8217;Alene,&#8221; Brunner said. &#8220;I had to catch a flight in Seattle, and I had a connection in Minneapolis and then on to Rapid City. After Rapid City, I will be up in Pueblo (Colo.) Sunday. It was a longer than usual Uber drive. It was about 30 minutes, and after finding out I won in Bremerton it made the ride worth it.&#8221;<br /><br />Other winners at the $156,697 rodeo were all-around cowboy <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/stetson-wright/96898" rel="smarttag" rev="96898">Stetson Wright</a> ($6,189, saddle bronc riding and bull riding); bareback rider <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/clayton-biglow/91652" rel="smarttag" rev="91652">Clayton Biglow</a> (90 points on Macza Pro Rodeo&#8217;s OLS Tubs Stevie Knicks); team ropers Nelson Wyatt/<a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/levi-lord/73087" rel="smarttag" rev="73087">Levi Lord</a> (4.1 seconds); saddle bronc rider K&#8217;s Thomson (88.5 points on Korkow Rodeos&#8217; Onion Ring); tie-down ropers <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/taylor-santos/73181" rel="smarttag" rev="73181">Taylor Santos</a> and <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/paden-bray/96229" rel="smarttag" rev="96229">Paden Bray</a> (8.2 seconds each); barrel racer Dona Kay Rule (16.92 seconds); and bull rider <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/stetson-wright/96898" rel="smarttag" rev="96898">Stetson Wright</a> (88.5 points on Macza Pro Rodeo&#8217;s OLS Tubs Riggs).</p>

<p><a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/shad-mayfield/97915" rel="smarttag" rev="97915">Shad Mayfield</a> took another small step towards repeating as the PRCA Tie-Down Roping World Champion at the Caldwell (Idaho) Night Rodeo Aug. 21. <br /><br />The Clovis, N.M., cowboy took home the title by winning the average with a  23.1-second time on three head. It was his seventh rodeo win this season, but this one meant even more to the reigning world champ. <br /><br />&#8220;I dedicated my run tonight to rodeo secretary Brenda Crowder,&#8221; said Mayfield 20. &#8220;She passed away this morning (Aug. 21) and I told myself I wanted to get the win for her. She&#8217;s always been like family to me, and all the contestants would say the same thing. She&#8217;s the best lady you&#8217;ll ever meet and we&#8217;re all going to miss her for sure.&#8221;<br /><br /><a href="https://prorodeo.com/news/2021/8/21/general-award-winning-secretary-timer-brenda-crowder-passes-away"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">RELATED: Award-winning secretary/timer Brenda Crowder passes away</span></strong></a><br /><br />With Brenda Crowder heavy on his heart Mayfield delivered an inspired performance in the finals. He secured the win with a 7.8-second run, which capped off three straight round wins in Caldwell.<br /><br />&#8220;My horse (Rampage) he&#8217;s a big part of all my success,&#8221; Mayfield said. &#8220;He was so good this weekend in Caldwell, he made it easy for me in all the rounds. I had three really good calves and I took advantage of that, I used them up, and ended up winning all three rounds.&#8221;<br /><br /><u><strong><a href="https://prorodeo.com/news/2021/8/21/general-braden-richardson-gets-clutch-win-in-baker-mont"><span style="color: #ff0000;">RELATED: Bull rider Braden Richardson wins in Baker, Mont.</span></a></strong></u><br /><br />Those three round wins brought Mayfield a hefty payday. He earned $13,676 to add to his already impressive 2021 season.  The Caldwell Night Rodeo is a stop on the ProRodeo Tour presented by Pendleton Whisky.<br /><br />&#8220;I love to win and that&#8217;s why I do this,&#8221; Mayfield said. &#8220;Like I&#8217;ve always said every dollar counts and coming off a world title makes me want to get another one. I&#8217;m trying to bump myself up there in the world standings before the end of the season. I&#8217;m sitting fourth right now, but I really want to go into the finals No. 1.&#8221;<br /><br />He hopes the Caldwell win will give himthe momentum to do just that.<br /><br /><strong><a href="https://prorodeo.com/standings"><span style="color: #ff0000;">PRCA | RAM World Standings</span></a></strong><br /><br />&#8220;You know this win is huge for me, and I&#8217;m dang sure going as hard as possible until Oct. 1,&#8221; Mayfield said. &#8220;I hope I can keep this momentum rolling right into the (Wrangler) NFR.&#8221;<br /><br />The PRCA regular season ends Sept. 30.<br /><br /><strong><a href="https://prorodeo.com/result/2021/caldwell-night-rodeo/10694"><span style="color: #ff0000;">RELATED: Complete results Caldwell </span></a></strong><br /><br />Other winners at the $339,778 rodeo were all-around cowboy <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/stetson-wright/96898" rel="smarttag" rev="96898">Stetson Wright</a>, $14,438 (saddle bronc riding and bull riding); bareback riders <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/cole-reiner/97895" rel="smarttag" rev="97895">Cole Reiner</a> and <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/kaycee-feild/21408" rel="smarttag" rev="21408">Kaycee Feild</a> (173 points each on two head); steer wrestler Clayton Haas (13.3 seconds on three head); team ropers <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/tyler-wade/59869" rel="smarttag" rev="59869">Tyler Wade</a>/<a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/trey-yates/72713" rel="smarttag" rev="72713">Trey Yates</a> (15.5 seconds on three head); saddle bronc rider <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/stetson-wright/96898" rel="smarttag" rev="96898">Stetson Wright</a> (176 points on two head); barrel racer <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/ivy-saebens/76486" rel="smarttag" rev="76486">Ivy Saebens</a> (51.94 seconds on three runs); and bull rider <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/stetson-wright/96898" rel="smarttag" rev="96898">Stetson Wright</a> (92 points on Powder River Rodeo&#8217;s Top Shelf).</p>
