<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>History of Miss Rodeo America</strong></h2>



<p>1955 was the first time when the concept of Miss Rodeo America (MRA) was developed under the assistance of International Rodeo Management (IRM). The first pageant at that year was held under the supervision of IRM first president Ray Peterson, Sr from Nevada.</p>



<p>Almost nine women had competed for the title, and Marilyn Scott
was the first woman who becomes the winner at the MRA first location Casper,
Wyoming. She was the first woman who experienced the luxuriousness of this
title for the years 1955 and 1956.</p>



<p>The second president after Ray Peterson was Fran Blomquist who was
from Idaho and served as the president of IRM for three consecutive years 1955,
1956 and 1957.</p>



<p>A total of 63 Miss Rodeo America bags their title since the year it started, and 2022 Miss Rodeo America Pageant will be the battle of Miss Rodeo America title.</p>



<p>Since the year it started, the eligibility of winning this title is based on a number of factors including personality, appearance, and horsemanship.</p>



<p>The winner of MRA gets the price worth $20,000, a crown that fits
on her cowboy hat, scholarships, Justin boots, wrangler apparel, and Montana
Silversmiths Jewelry and Belt buckles.</p>



<p>Besides that, the MRA also enjoys its reigns until the one year completes. They can travel almost 120,000 miles during the time of one year. They also get the opportunity to appear as a guest on local schools of America just to promote the Rodeo sport.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MRA Scholarship Foundation</strong></h2>



<p>Since the start of the Miss Rodeo America competition in 1955, it’s realized that there is a need for scholarships to help the contestant appearing in the event for their education.</p>



<p>1992 was the exact year when the pageant reached another milestone by awarding scholarships worth $30,000 to the contestants. This was the same historical year in the history of MRA for providing more educational dollars in a year more than the past 37 years of pageant journey.</p>



<p>1997 was the time when Miss Rodeo Scholarship foundation was
established to track the distributions of scholarships and to broad this
program on an upper level.</p>



<p>When the foundation was established, the winner for Miss Rodeo
America received the Scholarship price worth $20,000, and $1000 was distributed
among other contestants.</p>



<p>The prize money a winner receives will directly be sent to the
institution where they are going to study.</p>



<p>The scholarship distribution criteria for 2020 provide the same $20,000 to the winner of the Miss Rodeo America pageant. However, the other runners up will get the scholarship grant mentioned below.</p>



<ul><li>The first runner up will get $10,000.</li><li>The second runner up will get $8,000.</li><li>The third runner up will get $6,000.</li><li>While fourth to tenth runner ups will get $4000 to $1,500.</li><li>Those who appear in the contest will get $1,000.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Last Words</strong></h2>



<p>MRA is the biggest platform for women to showcase their talent,
experience the luxurious lifestyle once in their life by winning the title
based on their appearance, personality, and horsemanship. Since the launch of
this event more than 60 women’s have won this title and fulfilled their dreams.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Miss Rodeo America scholarship foundation realized the responsibility to help all the contestants based on their results, and allow them to pursue their education with the scholarships.</p>



<p>The idea was appreciated by the audience, and the event is becoming bigger every year for all.</p>
