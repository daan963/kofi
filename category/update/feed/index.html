<p><strong>With the strong influence of T20, there is a place for fear about the future of Test cricket. It has been accentuated by recent incidents in South Africa. They have given importance to the domestic T20 tournament by dropping a series that is part of the Test Championship. Based on this, the discussion has started again about the survival of the elite version of cricket. Joined by Brian Lara. The Caribbean wants this batting legend to live on in the glory of the beloved Test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A part of the cricketers have opted for T20 cricket after excluding the Test. There is increasing reluctance in the country&#8217;s central contracts to play franchise cricket. Meanwhile, South Africa has waived Tests to establish their own domestic franchise league. They have made it mandatory for local cricketers to play SA201 before the national team if they get a team.</p>



<p>So the Proteas have to take the Ankora team only once for the tour of New Zealand. Eight new faces in the 15-member squad announced for the two Tests. The combined experience of the remaining 7 is only 50 Tests.</p>



<p>The demand for West Indies cricketers in the franchise leagues is a little higher. They prefer to play in those tournaments over the national team in the hope of earning extra money. Therefore, the Caribbean has to take several new faces on the tour of Australia.</p>



<p>However, Lara does not blame the players here. Talking to &#8216;Da AJ&#8217;, the former West Indies captain said that they are looking for another way because they are not getting financial security for the future by playing for the national team.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t begrudge any player for making financial decisions to secure their future. Sports as a whole are very short-lived. In cricket, you never know when you will be in the team or when you will be out. We need to find a way that not just English, Australian or Indian cricket, but all forms of cricket will prosper.&#8221;</p>



<p>“You want your best team to play international cricket. South Africa will have their own reasons, but when I look at their team I don&#8217;t see a single name that I recognise.&#8221;</p>



<p>Spectators are also losing interest in Test cricket in this era of T20. However, the Test series of India, Australia, England shows some interest. All in all, Lara asked everyone concerned to think beyond these three countries to keep Test cricket alive.</p>



<p>“Having played Test cricket, I don&#8217;t want to see this version die because of love for the game. Hopefully, beyond India, Australia and England, we can bring back its importance to the West Indies, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa.”</p>
