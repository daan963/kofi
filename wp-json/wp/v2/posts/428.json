Because of\u00a0the impacts suffered, the recovery required between two matches is longer in rugby than in other disciplines.<\/p>\n<p>For this 2023 edition, the organizer World Rugby has decided to extend the schedule to give players more recovery time and preserve their health.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"subheading\">No longer disadvantage &#8220;small nations&#8221; as in 2019<\/h2>\n<p>Therefore, all teams have a minimum of five rest days between each game.\u00a0A way to avoid the errors of the last edition in Japan four years ago, when certain nations had to continue every four days.\u00a0For example, Russia had played the opening match against the Japanese on September 20, before continuing against Samoa on the 24th.<\/p>\n<p>It is for this reason that no match is scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. After playing on Friday, the Blues will play on Thursday against Uruguay (9 p.m.), then on the 21st against Namibia, and finally on October 6 against Italy for the last day of the group stage.<\/p>\n<p>Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/frontdoor.lcp.uk.com\/rugby-world-cup-2023-all-the-rules-for-beginners\/\">Rugby World Cup 2023: all the rules for beginners<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Rugby World Cup is off to a flying start in the four corners of France.\u00a0After eight matches in three days, we will however have to wait until Thursday before the next match of the competition.
