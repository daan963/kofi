Now he entered the Grand Slam fight. It&#8217;s great for the British star to be back on the big stage. Shelby swept Rogers in straight sets in the second round of the Australian Open.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 21-year-old player has not played in any major tournament since the last edition of this competition in Melbourne. He was off the court for about eight months after undergoing wrist and ankle surgery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day he returned to the majors with the first Grand Slam of the year, he defeated Rogers of the United States 6-3, 6-2 on Monday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the age of 18, Radukanu rose to the limelight of the tennis world by winning the 2021 US Open. In that incredible campaign, he became the first player in Grand Slam history to win the title after qualifying. An unknown name became a world star.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, though, Radukanu could not maintain that early lead. He contracted the coronavirus, followed by injuries, and luck was not on his side. His position is now 296 in the ranking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is a glimpse of that old rhythm returning to his game. He played excellent serves and groundstrokes on his way to crushing Rogers. Many are looking at how far Radukanu can pull the form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Radukanu will face China&#8217;s Wang Yafan next Thursday in the fight to advance to the third round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.assettype.com\/bdnews24%2F2024-01%2F27b8474d-2335-4ba3-a8fa-b04367ca8759%2Fnaomi_osaka_160124_02.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;format=webp&amp;w=1536\" alt=\"\u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09a1 \u09b8\u09cd\u09b2\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09c7 \u09ab\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u099f\u09be \u099c\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u09b0\u09be\u0999\u09be\u09b2\u09c7\u09a8 \u09b0\u09be\u09a1\u09c1\u0995\u09be\u09a8\u09c1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a long break, the return of another female star Naomi Osaka to the Grand Slam was not pleasant. After the maternity break, she returned to tennis with the Brisbane Open a few days ago. But lost in the second round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Japanese lost in the first round in the Australian Open. France&#8217;s Caholin Garcia defeated the two-time champion 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) in this Melbourne competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the 26-year-old star is not disappointed with this loss. The four-time Grand Slam winner in women&#8217;s singles wants to spend busy time on the front court to regain herself. That&#8217;s how you plan.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Emma Radukanu returned to the court a couple of months ago after being out for a long time due to injury.
