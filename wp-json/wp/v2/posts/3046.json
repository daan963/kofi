Her desire to be a rodeo queen was sparked after meeting an inspiring woman. \u201cWhen I was six years old, my parents took me to the Black Hills Stock Show, and that\u2019s where I met Selena Ulch Pope [Miss Rodeo America 2005]. The warmth and kindness that she showed to me\u2013I thought \u2018That\u2019s what I want to embody. That\u2019s the person I want to be,\u2019\u201d Livermont says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Livermont is most looking forward to is traveling and representing her title across the nation this year. She is excited to attend the <a href=\"https:\/\/fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au\/calgary-stampede-live-stream\/\">Calgary Stampede<\/a>, visit southwestern states, and especially rodeos closer to home in the Great Plains and Northern Badlands Region. Due to Covid uncertainties, many INFR tour rodeos are not scheduled at this point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, Livermont would like to represent her title in whatever capacity she is able. Following the lead of Miss Rodeo America, Jordan Tierney\u2013also from South Dakota\u2013she would like to host online classes to teach the basic tenets of becoming a rodeo queen, if she cannot host them in person. \u201cI thought that was a really neat idea: reaching people regardless of her circumstances, and that\u2019s what I want to do, too. Even though I can\u2019t necessarily be there, I still want to help other people,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to host clinics for young girls to help get their foot in the door for queening. I hope to start an online queening program that is free to all ages for moms and aspiring rodeo queens, showcasing the basics of it all. I do want to travel a lot, but due to Covid restrictions that may or may not be a possibility, but I will do so to the best of my ability,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Livermont is steeped in the ranching lifestyle. Having been raised on a ranch on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, she recognizes the values she grew up with. \u201cThe ranching and rodeo lifestyle is: helping each other out, learning about hard work, and learning that you have to build your way up and be humble the entire time, and always being grateful for what you are given,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Livermont, the horse she competed on in Vegas during the ambassador competition was named \u201cN\u00fa\u014bpa\u2014which is the Lakota word for \u2018two\u2019. He was named this because my brother Henry had two full brother red dun horses\u2014so he named them Wa\u014b\u017e\u00ed (one) and N\u00fa\u014bpa. Me and Henry traded horses and I\u2019ve had N\u00fa\u014bpa for about 6 or 7 years now,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>N\u00fa\u014bpa started out as a ranch horse but transitioned nicely into the life of a rodeo queen\u2019s horse and helped her to clinch the horsemanship award, as well as her title. The largest and most fun category for Livermont was the horsemanship section. She also won the categories of traditional presentation\u2013where the ladies dressed in traditional regalia and explained the significance of each part\u2013and Miss Congeniality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Livermont has a passion for serving others. Humility and consideration of others are key values for everyday life, and have translated to success in queening. \u201cI\u2019m proud of\u2026 having those virtues of helping others. In our culture, it\u2019s \u201cW\u00f3lak\u021fota\u201d, which is being very peaceful, and \u201cMit\u00e1kuye oy\u00e1si\u014b\u201d is looking out for your other relatives, because we are all related and we all have to help each other. It represents respecting your oy\u00e1te (tribe\/nation) and a reminder to us that we are all connected and to take care of all of your relatives (two-legged, four-legged, and Mother Earth),\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, Livermont was Miss Oglala Lakota Nation. She also competed for the titles of Miss Black Hills Stock Show &amp; Rodeo and Miss Black Hills Roundup in the past. \u201cThose were very good learning experiences. I learned what I need to do to tune myself on in order to be a better rodeo queen and shape myself,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe number one message I want to spread to people is to be the best version of yourself. The only person you are competing with, not only in the rodeo queen setting but in life, is yourself. Working on your skills, learning how to be the best version of yourself is what I want to spread to others, whether it be in or out of the rodeo arena,\u201d Livermont says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing to win this title has been a balancing act. Livermont is not only a full-time teller at Security First Bank in Rapid City, but she is also a part-time student at Casper College. After obtaining her Associate\u2019s Degree of Agricultural Business and Sciences, she plans to transfer to Oglala Lakota College to obtain her Bachelors in Business Management. \u201cHaving the experience in the banking industry, I hope to be a loan officer for the agricultural community one day, and be an advocate for them,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Dakota and surrounding states were well represented at the INFR. \u201cAll athletes\u2014both two and four legged\u2014really proved how strong rodeo in Indian Country really is. It was awesome to witness multiple South Dakota cowboys and cowgirls work the arena and even have a few walk away with world titles,\u201d Livermont says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>INFR Tour Rodeo champions from the Tri-State Livestock News area include:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bull Riding: Preston Louis of Browning, Montana,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bareback Riding: Steven DeWolfe of Buffalo Gap, South Dakota<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steer Wrestling: Tyler Byrne of Martin, South Dakota<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tie-Down Roping: Marty Watson of Box Elder, Montana<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Junior Barrels: Kashlin Bettelyoun of Pine Ridge, South Dakota<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senior Team Roping: Don Bettelyoun of Pine Ridge, South Dakota.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Area World Champions include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saddle Bronc Riding: Cole Elshere of Faith, South Dakota<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barrel Racing: Tatum Ward of Whitehorse, South Dakota<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steer Wrestling: Nolan Conway of Cut Bank, Montana<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tsln.com\/\">Tri-State Livestock News<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Miss Indian Rodeo 2021 is Tigh Livermont of Wanblee, South Dakota.
