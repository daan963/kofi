Finally, many others are playing big this weekend. <em>Rugby News<\/em>\u00a0tells you everything.<\/p>\n<h2>2023 World Cup: the qualifiers<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Wales<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is the first team to qualify for the quarter-finals of the 2023 World Cup. By inflicting a historic defeat on Australia (40-6) last week, Wales also validated their ticket to the next round.<\/p>\n<p>With three wins in three games and 14 points on the clock, the Welsh are guaranteed to finish in the top two of Pool C, even before playing their last match.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>England<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The second qualifier for the 2023 World Cup is England. In Pool D, Le XV de la Rose took advantage of Samoa&#8217;s defeat against Japan to validate their place in the quarter-final.<\/p>\n<p>With 14 points on the clock and taking advantage of the bonus points left by their opponents, the English are guaranteed to finish in first place in their group, even before playing their last match.<\/p>\n<h2>2023 World Cup: those eliminated<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Namibia<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In Pool A, Namibia have finished their Rugby World Cup. The Welwitschias have been eliminated for a week and a third defeat in three games. The fourth setback came on Wednesday against Uruguay.<\/p>\n<p>Namibia is the first nation to complete its World Cup. The players will enjoy their last days in Paris and return to the country or their respective clubs at the end of the weekend.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uruguay<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the same group, Uruguay is also eliminated from the World Cup. Beaten by France and Ital, Los Teros, winners of Namibia, can no longer hope to finish in the first two of the group. They will play one last match against New Zealand.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Romania<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Romania is already eliminated in Pool B after two crushing defeats against Ireland (82-8) and South Africa (76-0). The Romanians will play against Scotland and Tonga and can hope, at best, for third place, which qualifies for the next Rugby World Cup.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chili<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, Chile was officially eliminated from the World Cup in Pool D after three defeats in three matches. The South Americans will finish their competition this weekend with a final game against Argentina.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Georgia and Samoa<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This Saturday, September 30, 2 new teams were eliminated. Amoa said goodbye to the 2023 Rugby World Cup with Argentina&#8217;s victory. For its part, Georgia, which did not win any of its first three matches, was officially eliminated after its defeat against Fiji (17-12).<\/p>\n<p>For more information about RWC updates and TV Channels, please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/frontdoor.lcp.uk.com\/\">frontdoor.lcp.uk.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>RUGBY.
