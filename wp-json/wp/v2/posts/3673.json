His first-go effort of 78 points was solid, but not good enough to place among the top four scores and earn him any money. <br \/><br \/>After reviewing the second-go order, Watts found himself as the last man up. <br \/><br \/>&#8220;The second round was our semi-eliminators, and they posted the buck order beforehand, so I knew I was last and I kind of knew what I had to be. And I knew I had one of the more rider-friendly ones in that round,&#8221; Watts said. &#8220;I had actually been on him before and he kind of led me around, but I just knew if I started him good, he&#8217;d be good, and it all worked out pretty good.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>His 81.5-point effort on Championship Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Bonafide ended up being the highest scoring saddle bronc ride of the entire rodeo. The momentum didn&#8217;t stop there as Watts posted a third-round effort of 81 points on Dakota Rodeo&#8217;s Back Page, propelling him to an aggregate score of 240.5 points on three-head, good enough to hold off Byron Gilliland by seven points for the title.<br \/><br \/>Success in the Great Lakes Circuit is nothing new to Watts as he has previously won the season-long circuit championship and placed runner-up in 2020 and 2021 at the culminating rodeo competition.<br \/><br \/>Despite only being a rookie during the 2023 season, Watts has seen a lot of action competing on his permit. He&#8217;s quickly learned that his riding prowess is only half the battle to being successful in the sport, which makes weekends like this last one so important. <br \/><br \/>&#8220;Looking back now, I didn&#8217;t realize it then, but I had a lot of things go my way (when I won the circuit). I drew really good all year. And the past couple years, I kind of struggled to draw good,&#8221; Watts said. &#8220;This year, I just didn&#8217;t let myself get down if I didn&#8217;t draw good and I just tried to capitalize when I did have a good one. I won some really cool rodeos this year, but it was kind of feast or famine I would say. But it was a good year I would say.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>The win in Louisville, Ky., gives Watts a head start on the 2024 season, putting just shy of $8,300 on his ledger for the new year. <br \/><br \/>If he can draw a few good horses this winter, the up-and-coming saddle bronc rider could set himself up for a special season. It&#8217;s a challenge Watt is excited to face. <br \/><br \/>&#8220;This win was really important. Hopefully I can get into some of these bigger winter rodeos now that I have a little bit of money won,&#8221; he said. <br \/><br \/>Other winners at the $219,806 rodeo were all-around cowboy Fenton Nelsen ($7,376, tie-down roping and steer wrestling); bareback rider Tanner Aus (243.5 points on three head); steer wrestler Chance Carlson (15.0 seconds on three head); team ropers Cody Reed\/Jace McDaniel, (11.6 seconds on two head); tie-down roper Dallen McIntire (26.5 seconds on three head, $3,688); barrel racer Lacinda Rose (46.03 seconds on three head); bull rider Jarett Evans (165.5 points on two head).<\/p><div class=\"gmaez657857570ff27\" ><p class=\"has-text-color has-background\" style=\"background-color: #1612d9; color: #f8f5f7; font-size: 19px; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ffffff; font-size: 18pt;\"><a style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/cowboychannel.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Watch NFR  2023 Live Online - SUBSCRIBE HERE<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<table style=\"background-color: white; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; border: 0px; color: #373737; font-family: 'Droid Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; width: 99.2948%; height: 189px;\"><caption style=\"background-color: #f8f8f8; border-bottom-color: #ff4000; border-bottom-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 4px; font-family: 'Open Sans Light', 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; height: 40px; line-height: 40px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 0.5em; text-align: center; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: nowrap;\">NFR  2023 Streaming info<\/caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 27px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 27px; width: 51.1304%;\"><\/td>\n<td style=\"height: 27px; width: 20.174%;\">Streaming<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 27px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 27px; width: 51.1304%;\">The Cowboy Channel (real-time)<\/td>\n<td style=\"height: 27px; width: 20.174%;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/cowboychannel.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Watch Here<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 27px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 27px; width: 51.1304%;\">RFD-TV (real-time)<\/td>\n<td style=\"height: 27px; width: 20.174%;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/cowboychannel.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Watch Here<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 27px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 27px; width: 51.1304%;\">Cowboy Channel Plus (International)<\/td>\n<td style=\"height: 27px; width: 20.174%;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/cowboychannel.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Watch Here<\/a><\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/div><style type=\"text\/css\">\r\n@media screen and (min-width: 1201px) {\r\n.gmaez657857570ff27 {\r\ndisplay: block;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n@media screen and (min-width: 993px) and (max-width: 1200px) {\r\n.gmaez657857570ff27 {\r\ndisplay: block;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n@media screen and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 992px) {\r\n.gmaez657857570ff27 {\r\ndisplay: block;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 768px) {\r\n.gmaez657857570ff27 {\r\ndisplay: block;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {\r\n.gmaez657857570ff27 {\r\ndisplay: block;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n<\/style>\r\n\n<p>Courtesy of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.prorodeo.com\/\">PRCA<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trey Watts looked over the order of go and knew what he had to do.
