The top two nations in each group will advance to the quarterfinals, followed by the semi-finals and final on Saturday, October 28, at the Stade de France.<\/p>\n<p>4 teams seem to be above this year, with New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, and the XV of France, with an outcome that we hope is happy for our Blues!<\/p>\n<h2>RUGBY WORLD PREDICTION 2023: WHO WILL BE CROWNED WORLD CHAMPION?<\/h2>\n<p>At every Rugby World Cup, New Zealand is the favorite. But this year, bookmakers do not hesitate to put the XV of France at the same height as the triple world champions. They were closely followed by the reigning world champions, South Africa, and the winners of the last 6 Nations tournament the previous spring, Ireland, which has never been stronger. Behind, England and Australia are a notch below this year, but be careful not to underestimate them.<\/p>\n<h3>2023 WORLD CUP PREDICTION: THE ODDS OF THE FUTURE WINNER<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>France: Rating of 3.75<\/li>\n<li>New Zealand: rating of 3.75<\/li>\n<li>South Africa: odds of 5.50<\/li>\n<li>Ireland: odds of 5.50<\/li>\n<li>England: odds of 12.00<\/li>\n<li>Australia: odds of 12.00<\/li>\n<li>Argentina: odds of 30.00<\/li>\n<li>Wales: odds of 35.00<\/li>\n<li>Scotland: odds of 50.00<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>The odds have been taken on the <a href=\"https:\/\/frontdoor.lcp.uk.com\">Rwcupdates<\/a> website and can change up to a few minutes before the start of the competition.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>OUR GROUP A PREDICTION: FRANCE \u2013 NEW ZEALAND \u2013 ITALY \u2013 NAMIBIA \u2013 URUGUAY<\/h2>\n<p>The two main favorites of this Rugby World Cup 2023, France and New Zealand, are in the same group during this group stage. And precisely, these two teams will face each other in the opening match on September 8 at the Stade de France. And this meeting will determine 99% of the winner of this group.<\/p>\n<p>And in a context where tension will be present, our rugby prediction will bet on the success of the All-Blacks against the French, who could be tense and stressed by the event. A lot of expectations around the XV of France could add extra pressure, and when it comes to facing the most impressive team on the planet, it could make a difference. Even if Antoine Dupont&#8217;s partners lose this match and finish only second, the impact would be limited since, in the quarterfinals, it will be either South Africa or Ireland, that is to say, the other favorites of the tournament\u2014an advantage for New Zealand in group A of the Rugby World Cup.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rugby World Cup prediction Group A: New Zealand group winners (odds of 1.90)<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>OUR PREDICTION GROUP B: SOUTH AFRICA \u2013 IRELAND \u2013 SCOTLAND \u2013 TONGA \u2013 ROMANIA<\/h2>\n<p>This Group B will be the group of death of this World Cup with the Boks, the Irish, and the Scots, with only two places for the quarterfinals. A team will be left out after the 4 games where each victory will be worth its weight of gold.<\/p>\n<p>And if the fight is fierce, especially between the Boks and the Irish, our rugby prediction will bet on a victory of the XV of the Clover in this group B. Jonathan Sexton&#8217;s partners have been impressive for 3 seasons now, and the Grand Slam was achieved last spring and confirmed the tour won the previous year with the Blacks. If the duel against the reigning world champions will be of rare intensity, playing in Europe with a stadium that will be green will give a significant advantage to finish in first place in Group B.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rugby World Cup prediction Group B: Ireland group winners (odds of 2.00)<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>OUR PREDICTION GROUP C: AUSTRALIA \u2013 WALES \u2013 FIJI \u2013 GEORGIA \u2013 PORTUGAL<\/h2>\n<p>This group C will probably be the weakest in this world, where the Australians and the Welsh should fight for the first place unless the Fijians manage to create a feat.<\/p>\n<p>The Wallabies remain on a failed Rugby Championship with 3 defeats in as many games, despite the assumption of office of Eddy Jones, who had come to the rescue after an autumn tour also catastrophic. The Welsh, on their side, are also in a slack period, with two last tournaments of the 6 Nations failing. But in a generational low, the Leek XV will have a hard time preventing the Australians from finishing in the first place, the Wallabies, who have a more extensive but also more talented squad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rugby World Cup prediction Group C: Australia group winner (odds of 1.30)<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>OUR PREDICTION GROUP D: ENGLAND \u2013 ARGENTINA \u2013 JAPAN \u2013 SAMOA \u2013 CHILE<\/h2>\n<p>4 years ago, Argentina and England were in the same group for this Rugby World Cup 2023. And if in Japan, the Argentines had bitten the dust and had not passed the first round, it should be better in France this year, with the XV de la Rose as its primary opponent.<\/p>\n<p>If the English come out of a problematic 6 Nations tournament, the experience of Steve Borthwick&#8217;s men should be able to make the difference against the Pumas. Owen Farrell and his teammates have learned a lot from their defeat against his same Argentines in a test match last autumn, and Michael Cheika&#8217;s men could this time suffer the strength of the English pack.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rugby World Cup prediction Group D: England group winners (odds of 1.40)<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>RUGBY WORLD CUP 2023 PREDICTION: THE PLAYERS TO FOLLOW TO WIN!<\/h2>\n<p>All competitions are full of stars who could make you win big at this Rugby World Cup. These try markers will be followed throughout the competition and all the matches they participate in.<\/p>\n<p>Honor to the France winger Damian Penaud who could be one of the stars of this world.
