The name of the Brazilian great has announced a new award of women&#8217;s football &#8211; &#8216;Marta Award.&#8217;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marta holds the record for the highest number of goals scored by men and women in the World Cup with 17 goals. He is also the first player to score five consecutive goals on the world stage of football. FIFA honored him with a special trophy at The Best FIFA Football Awards in London on Monday night for his contribution to football for more than 20 years. It was there that the award of the best goal of the year was announced under the name of the women&#8217;s football superstar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marta also once held the record for both men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s FIFA Footballer of the Year awards, winning six times. Later he was overtaken by Argentine superstar Lionel Messi. This is the eighth time he has won this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>FIFA has an award for the best goal of the year. Since 2009, they have been giving the Puskas Award for spectacular goals. The first was won by Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. For a stunning goal from 40 yards for Manchester United in the Champions League quarter-final against Porto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real Madrid and Hungary legend Puskas could not see the award launched in his name. He died in 2006, the award was launched in October 2009.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both male and female footballers were considered for the award, but for the first two years only men were in the top ten. USA&#8217;s Heather O&#8217;Reilly made it to the list of top 10 goals for her great goal against Colombia in 2011 World Cup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, a woman made the top three for the first time. Ireland&#8217;s Stephanie Rush finished second behind Colombia&#8217;s James Rodriguez. Since then, only two others &#8211; Daniuska Rodr\u00edguez (2016) and Denia Castianos (2017) from Venezuela &#8211; have made the top three.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Puskas Award is determined by a vote of football fans registered on the FIFA website. There, male footballers who are far ahead in terms of fan base have an added advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alecia Russo was considered a strong contender last year to become the first female footballer to win the award. The English forward scored a stunning back-heel goal against Sweden at the Women&#8217;s Euros. But he could not come in the top three.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Puskas Award had been launched in the previous year instead of 2009, Marta might have been considered. He scored a brilliant goal in the 4-0 World Cup semi-final win over the USA.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marta is very happy to receive the award in her own name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOf course, it (becoming a record six FIFA Man of the Year) gives me great joy. But this recognition elevates not only Marta, but all of us\u2014Brazil as a nation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I will not play again in the World Cup. I am very happy with the way women&#8217;s football has developed in Brazil and in the world. There are incredibly talented girls who have great futures ahead of them. It&#8217;s just the beginning for them, but the end for me.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FIFA not only honored Marta Vieira de Silva for her long career, but also gave great recognition.
