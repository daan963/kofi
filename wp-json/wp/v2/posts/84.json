The entity that regulates rugby worldwide could make a change in it, which would be that the ejected player should leave the field of play and, after 20 minutes, could be replaced by another player.<\/p>\n<p>As reported by The Telegraph, World Rugby would consider introducing the 20-minute red card. The law, which is already in force in Super Rugby and was implemented in the 2021 Rugby Championship, means that the sent-off player can be tactically replaced by a teammate after 20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin assured the British outlet that this is already under discussion: &#8220;That has been discussed before and will be discussed again. It would be great if more competitions, even in a closed test, used it because That would give us an overview of the effect it would have on the game.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the manager added: &#8220;We need to see more data to see if that strikes a better balance between safety and spectacle. There is more work to be done to analyze that and the concern is if a team goes back to 15 players, It&#8217;s enough of a deterrent to driving that behavior change. We&#8217;d like to see it tested more widely before jumping to conclusions.<\/p>\n<h3>A healthy habit! The Argentines unstitched it abroad<\/h3>\n<p>Like every weekend, the presence of Argentines in the different leagues around the world does not go unnoticed and this time was no exception.<\/p>\n<p>For the Super Rugby Pacific, in the match against the Blues, which resulted in a historic 27-23 victory for the visitors, Pablo Matera honored his eighth-rank nature and held the ball despite the tackle received, thus assisting Sevu Reece.<\/p>\n<p>In the activity corresponding to the Champions Cup, Agust\u00edn Creevy and Juan Mart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez had a sensational performance in the 64-27 win against Castres. On the hooker&#8217;s side, Creevy contributed a double: similar plays, the forward used his power to advance in the maul and slide into the French goal without major inconvenience.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the third line, Gonz\u00e1lez was very active when assisting Curtis Rona and then had the opportunity to dispatch with a try, when he found himself as a free receiver on the touchline.<\/p>\n<p>Pablo Dimcheff made a name for himself in the French Pro D2 with Stade Montois&#8217; 34-13 victory over Beziers. The Argentine took advantage of his closeness to the goal and used the pick &amp; go resource to add five points to his team&#8217;s scoreboard.<\/p>\n<p>While his future is uncertain, Pablo Matera continues to demonstrate a high level in Super Rugby Pacific in the Crusaders jersey. In his team&#8217;s 27-24 loss to the Blues, the third row set up for Sevu Reece. In addition, he had a fan of luxury, his son saw him from the stands.<\/p>\n<p>Champions Cup: with a superlative Lowe, Leinster advanced to the round<\/p>\n<p>The second leg corresponding to the Champions Cup round of 16 matches began on Friday. In the only game of the day, Leinster beat Connacht 26-21. The action will continue on Saturday and Sunday with the following duels: Bordeaux-La Rochelle, Sale Sharks-Bristol Bears, Toulouse-Ulster, Stade Francais-Racing 92, Exeter Chiefs-Munster; Montpellier-Harlequins and Clermont-Leicester Tigers.<\/p>\n<p>Connacht excited the first 10 minutes with a penalty from Jack Carty, but everything fell apart with Leinster&#8217;s first advance. With James Lowe in love with the goal, author of four tries, the local managed the match. With conquests by Jameson Gibson Park, Robbie Henshaw, Tadhg Furlong and James Lowe, he settled the game in the first half and added Jonathan Sexton&#8217;s 4 conversions. The complement was a monologue of the blues with the conquest of Robbie Henshaw and James Lowe&#8217;s one-man three times. Connacht tried but reached the goal when everything was already defined with Tiernan O&#8217;Halloran, Sammy Arnold and Abraham Papali&#8217;i.<\/p>\n<p>And Read More About: <a href=\"https:\/\/frontdoor.lcp.uk.com\/\">Watch Rugby World Cup Live Stream 2023 France Online<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>World Rugby would be considering modifying the red card rule, with a view to the World Cup in France in 2023.
