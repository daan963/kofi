However, the reason why the evidence was not available at the time was not sufficiently stated.<\/p>\n<p>Van den Berg is still being looked at by Spain&#8217;s national sports disciplinary body and &#8220;may be subject to criminal punishment,&#8221; according to World Rugby&#8217;s written decision.<\/p>\n<p>Romania would now qualify for Europe 2 in place of Spain and would be placed in Pool B. Additionally, Portugal would take the position of Romania in the Final Qualifying Tournament, which will be held in November 2022.<\/p>\n<p>As of right now, Romania will join South Africa, Ireland, and Scotland in Pool B for the 2023 World Cup. Portugal will have one more chance to qualify for the tournament in the repackage phase later this year after coming close to beating Italy at the weekend but ultimately falling short 38-31.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Spain&#8217;s attempt to have their disqualification for violating player eligibility regulations overturned was unsuccessful, hence they will not be participating in the 2023 World Cup.
