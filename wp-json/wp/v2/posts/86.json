After twenty-four years, our country has qualified and will play the World Cup held in France in 2023.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Despite the time remaining for the championship to start,\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.betfair.es\/sport\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">online sports betting<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0houses already allow bids on it. But what chance does Spain have of playing a good role?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The favorites to win the World Cup<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Unfortunately, Spain has no chance of winning the World Cup. We have a good team, which has played a magnificent role in the qualifying phase. But our rugby is still very far from the one practiced by the big six in Europe. Among them may be the winner of the tournament.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Specifically France, Italy, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and England. But undoubtedly, the legendary New Zealand All Blacks are also favorites, who will once again delight us with their impressive\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">haka<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Not surprisingly, the team has won the world title the most times: three have lifted the Webb Ellis Cup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, we cannot forget about other selections always among the favorites. This is the case of the South African springboks, who, not in vain, are the reigning champions. And also from the Australian team. The famous Wallabies have two World Cup titles and are always candidates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, we must make a special mention of the host team. France is the winner of the 2022 Six Nations Tournament. It also won the Grand Slam, the Garibaldi Trophy (award for the winner between France and Italy), and the Auld Alliance (prize for the winner between Scotland and France). If we add that they will play at home, supported by their fans, we must consider the Gauls among the main favorites.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What chance does Spain have?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although they cannot win the World Cup, the Spanish team can do a good job. The classification to participate in this final phase is already a success. They have only achieved it once, 24 years ago, as it was in the championship held in Wales in 1999.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On the other hand, we already know the teams that will face our representatives. It will be Ireland, Scotland, South Africa, and the winner of the tie between the Pacific and Asia, which will possibly be Tonga.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Because of the potential of these rivals, all the experts consider that it would be a success to get a victory. Winning a match could not be done in our previous participation in Wales, and doing so would mean an advance in consideration of Spanish rugby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In conclusion, we will have to wait a year to find out the 2023 Rugby World Cup winner. The sports press and bookmakers will thoroughly report on the tournament until then.
