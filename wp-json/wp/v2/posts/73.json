This great sporting event brings together the enthusiasm of the entire planet every four years. It is, therefore, a new satisfaction for the city of Marseille, which has so many times been able to demonstrate its ability to host major international competitions that arouse widespread enthusiasm.<\/p>\n<p>With the qualifications from Georgia and Spain, we now know the identities of 16 of the 20 countries qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France. For a few days, some countries have made official the cities where they will have their headquarters for the planetary meeting. This Thursday, March 24, 2022, the city of Nice has been chosen by Scotland.<\/p>\n<p>Greenpeace France went directly to Claude Atcher, managing director of the 2023 Men&#8217;s Rugby World Cup, to demand the breaking of the association with TotalEnergies Greenpeace explained that he was in contact at the end of last year with the organization, which wanted to make an event that respects the environment and is committed to the climate.<\/p>\n<p>England at Le Touquet, Wales at Versailles<br \/>\nWales, coming off a dismal 5th place in the Tournament and 6 Nations and a surprise defeat at home to Italy (21-22), opted for Versailles.<\/p>\n<p>Where England preferred the setting of Le Touquet, this is excellent news for Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, a sporting paradise and the most British of French resorts. \u00bb rejoiced the mayor of Le Touquet, Daniel Fasquelle. For England, it is a strategic place: in addition to the close presence of its fans, the XV de la Rose will play two group matches in the North.<\/p>\n<p>The XV of France in Ruel-Malmaison?<\/p>\n<p>For its part, the XV of France would have decided not to take advantage of the ultra-advantageous facilities of the Marcoussis CNR to maintain specific equity with the rest of the teams. If nothing is official yet, Rueil-Malmaison (92), with its Renaissance Paris Hippodrome hotel in Saint-Cloud, which hosted the Blues just before the match against England, would hold the rope. The discussions are on the right track, and this seems to be confirmed,&#8221; Rueil-Malmaison city council told our colleagues at Actu Hauts-de-Seine.<\/p>\n<p>One of the perennial favorites of this considerable competition in New Zealand. Land of rugby, and winners of the Rugby Championship, the Blacks team will be eager to perform as usual to become the only rugby team to have won the most World Cups. Therefore, Sam Whitelock&#8217;s men will land in France with a more than committed squad. The French XV will have to be wary of them for the first time in the opening match on September 8 at the Stade de France before perhaps meeting them for the second time in the competition&#8217;s final on this very turf.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Wednesday, Greenpeace France published an open letter to the director of the 2023 Rugby World Cup, which will take place in France, asking him to exclude TotalEnergies as a competition sponsor.
