He tried to run two or three times, but it didn&#8217;t seem like he could do much good. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mashrafe&#8217;s old leg pain increased after the election campaign. Meanwhile Sylhet Strikers announced him as the captain. However, there was still uncertainty whether Mashrafe would play from the first match or not. However, the vice-captain of the team Mohammad Mithun said on Thursday, &#8220;As far as we know, he is available. &#8216;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mashrafe joined Sylhet&#8217;s practice for a while on Thursday. But this time batting-bowling did nothing. Yet the whole team looked motivated. Mohammad Mithun says, Mashrafe is always like this. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said, &#8216;Bhai Mashrafe is not like this now, he was like this before. Blend in with the team very quickly. When he came to the field yesterday, he didn&#8217;t practice but he made a match in the 10-15 minutes he was with the team. We all know how Mashrafe Bhai is, no one will have any difficulty in getting along with him. &#8216;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a lot of discussion and criticism before the start of last season&#8217;s BPL. The lack of DRS was also talked about a lot. What difference do you see this time with the last season? Such a question was asked to Mithun. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said, &#8220;As players, we don&#8217;t look for so much difference. We are busy preparing how we can do better. We are looking into that. If the difference is, as I said in the team meeting yesterday, DRS is there from the beginning, it is certainly something to be applauded. &#8216;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of the tournament is to improve our native cricketers. Of course, domestic players always have a chance. Because it is our only tournament coverage, it is called our biggest stage. The highlights are good if you perform here. That&#8217;s why all our cricketers try to talk about the best performance in BPL. &#8216;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mashrafe will play in BPL from the first match It was almost evening.
