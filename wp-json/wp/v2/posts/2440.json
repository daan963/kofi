It is planned from Thursday, December 2nd to Saturday, December 11th. Due to Covid-19 engaging in various sporting activities around the world, the Wrangler NFR was relocated from its official convention center in Las Vegas to Thomas &amp; Mack Center, Las Vegas, NV.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officials and organizers said NFR&#8217;s move is meant to be in keeping with health and safety protocols, and bringing fans what they love without putting their health at risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the event was postponed, nothing was changed. A fan like you will continue to be able to cheer your favorite <a href=\"https:\/\/fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au\/standings\/bareback\/\">bareback riding<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au\/standings\/bull-riding\/\">bull riding<\/a>, saddle bronc riding, <a href=\"https:\/\/fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au\/standings\/barrel-racing\/\">barrel racing<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au\/standings\/steer-wrestling\/\">steer wrestling<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au\/standings\/tie-down-roping\/\">tie-down roping<\/a>, and team roping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While NFR has grown into one of the most competitive and fun <a href=\"https:\/\/fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au\/schedule\/\">rodeo events<\/a> in recent years, it has also gained Tramandeneou&#8217;s popularity around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of people around the world get physically glued to their televisions, various streaming devices, and others on the field as the best cowboys and cowgirls in the world put on their boots and take each other out to try and win the World Cup on around 15 Round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be among those who cheer on top cowboys and cowgirls, you need to mark up your calendar. Since it is one of your favorite events, you shouldn&#8217;t miss even a fraction of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the ticket is limited and has been cut as much as possible in terms of social distance by limiting contacts in the field amid this highly contagious coronavirus. It is possible that you will not be able to get to Texas for reasons known to you, including ticket, travel, and other expenses. However, there is still the option to follow your favorite event from the comfort of your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cowboy Channel and Rural Media Group made it possible for those who won&#8217;t be coming to Texas for 2021 NFR. The schedule has already expired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the full schedule and where to watch or listen to your favorite event for each day every 10 days over NFR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Outside the barrel: 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. ET<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside the barrel is one of the most prevalent NFR fascinations outside of the arena.
