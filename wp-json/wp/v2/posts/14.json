Former national team captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza has become a member of parliament for the second time.The current captain Shakib Al Hasan has also become a member of Parliament this time. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of them are still playing. They will also play in the BPL starting tomorrow. Mashrafe Sylhet Strikers and Shakib&#8217;s team Rangpur Riders. Tamim Iqbal is a long time teammate of these two. Will you congratulate them for being members of parliament?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to such a question, he told reporters after the practice of Fortune Barisal at BKSP on Thursday, &#8220;None of the two have met me yet. If we meet, we will definitely talk. Let&#8217;s see what happens then. &#8216;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>International cricket is almost at an end for Tamim too. Now the question in the minds of many is whether Tamim will ever be elected? He did not want to answer such questions directly. However, he claims that there is no such plan so far. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said, &#8220;This is a very risky thing, brother. I said no, then it happened after ten years. Then you&#8217;ll pretend I wasn&#8217;t saying that. Never say no to anything. But as of now I have no such plans. &#8216;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current BCB President Nazmul Hasan Papon has taken charge as Sports Minister. He also said to leave the responsibility of the board. Shakib said that he wants to go and take this responsibility at some point. Tamim also has such a dream?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said, &#8216;You never know where the future will take you. If Allah writes something like that on my forehead, it will happen automatically. I can&#8217;t take it by force. &#8216;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The crowd of star cricketers is increasing now in the national elections.
