The champions started their journey to the Federation Cup after defeating Chittagong Abahani.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohammedan won 2-1 at Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni Stadium in Gopalganj. Mozaffar Mozaffarov made the fate of the match after Zafar Iqbal equalized the team behind Aziz Abolaji Abu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On this day, the beginning of Mohammedan was simple. The team in the rhythm of the Premier League scored in the 13th minute from a set piece. Sujan Biswas beat Sujan Biswas with an unguarded Nigerian forward, Abu Ghraman, who received the ball from a free kick at the far post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After falling behind, Mohammedans regained momentum in the game. In first-half stoppage time, Zafar raced over to find the back of the net after Mozaffarov&#8217;s curling free kick went over the wall and hit the post. The white and black jersey holders go to the break with the relief of equality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second half, Mohammedan continued to increase the intensity of the attack. The 11-time champions, second highest in the competition, got the desired goal in the 55th minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A defender of Chittagong Abahani could not clear the corner head. The ball went to the far post, from where Emmanuel Sund&#8217;s head keeper Ashraful Islam Rana was blocked by Uzbekistan midfielder Mozaffarov on the return side volley.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After going forward, Mohammedan concentrated on the game keeping the defense frozen. In the 63rd minute, Shahriar Emon could not take a proper header. The gap did not increase as the ball that went up quite high easily deposited in Rana&#8217;s gloves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end, Chittagong Abahani tried desperately to return to the match; But Mohammedan&#8217;s solid defense kept their efforts from outside the box.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 85th minute, Rayhan Hasan&#8217;s curling free kick attempted to find the net at the far post. Goalkeeper Sujan kept Mohammedan on the way to victory with a lot of jumps and fists.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mohammedan turned around a little late after handling the shock of falling back in the beginning.
