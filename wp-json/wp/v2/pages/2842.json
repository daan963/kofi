It is one of rodeo\u2019s most physically demanding events, taking a heavy toll on the cowboy\u2019s body. A successful ride depends on the cowboy\u2019s spurring technique and his ability to look good while being tossed about on the back of the bucking bronc. As there is nothing attached to the horse\u2019s head, the cowboy never knows exactly where that horse is going, and must take what suprises come in stride. The cowboy once again is required to hang on with one hand only to a specialized piece of equipment called a bareback rigging which fits over the withers (top of the back above the shoulders) and is attached by a cinch around the belly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Saddle Bronc Riding<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Saddle Bronc Riding is a classic rodeo event requiring strength, style, grace and precise timing. The rider must synchronize his moves with the motion of the horse, the performance goal being a smooth ride and a high score. A thick rope rein is attached to the horses halter and the cowboy is seated in a special \u201cbronc saddle\u201d. If the rider touches any part of the horse or his own body with his free hand he is disqualified.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bull Riding<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bull Riding is the most dangerous event in rodeo and likewise the most popular with spectators. Every bull is unique, with different dispositions and styles of bucking. Some bulls buck straight ahead, some are \u201cspinners\u201d, bucking and jumping in tight circles and some bulls, the \u201cbad\u201d bulls, have only one thing in mind, physical revenge. Serious injury or death are always a possibility to riders in this event. The bulls used in this event weigh in at a ton or more and often have dangerous horns. Bull riding requires balance, flexibility, coordination, quick reflexes and intense physical strength. Courage is also a prerequisite for a bull rider. Riders are judged on their form and style and are disqualified if they touch the animal with the free hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Steer Wrestling<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Steer Wrestling is one of the quickest events in rodeo and also one of the most challenging. The cowboy must leap onto the steer from a galloping horse and wrestle the steer to the ground. The cowboy is assisted on his left by a hazer that helps to keep the steer moving in a straight line. Steers usually weigh more than twice the weight of a cowboy so strength coupled with speed and precision are important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tie Down Roping<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tie Down Roping showcases the skills of both the cowboy and his horse. The cowboy must throw his rope accurately and the horse must pull back hard enough to take of the slack in the rope, but not so hard as too pull the calf of it\u2019s feet. Horses are trained to come to a stop after the calf is caught and to watch the calf at all times, keeping the rope tight. After the cowboy has tied the calf\u2019s legs, the cowboy mounts his horse and moves forward to create slack in the rope. For a qualifying score, the calf must stay tied and not kick free for six seconds. The combination of the cowboy\u2019s skill with a rope, coordination and sprinting ability and the horse\u2019s athleticism come into play in this fast paced event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Team Roping<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Team roping also known as heading and heeling is a rodeo event that features a steer (typically a Corriente ) and two mounted cowboys. A rope of designated length determined by the length of the box is fastened around the steer\u2019s neck which is used to ensure that the steer gets a head start. On one side of the chute is the header whose job is to rope the steer around the horns, neck or half-head, and turn the steer to the left. On the other side of the chute is the heeler whose job is to rope the steer around the hind legs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The header sits on his horse to the left of the steer in an area called the box . A taut rope fastened with an easily broken string called the barrier runs in front of the header and is fastened to the rope on the steer. When the header is ready, he calls for the steer and the chute help trips a lever opening the doors. The suddenly freed steer breaks out running. When the steer reaches the end of the rope, the string breaks and simultaneously releases the barrier. The header must rope the steer and then take a dally , that is a couple of wraps of the rope around the horn of the saddle. Speed is important and some have lost fingers in this event. Once the header has made the dally, he will turn his horse and the steer will follow, still running.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The heeler waits until the header has turned the steer. When he has a clear way, he throws a loop of rope under the running steer\u2019s hind legs and catches them. As soon as the steer is stretched out, an official drops a flag and the time is taken. The steer is released and trots off. There is a 5 second penalty for roping only one hind leg and a 10 second penalty for breaking the barrier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Barrel Racing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Barrel racing , is a rodeo event that features a horse or barrel racer and one rider, running a cloverleaf pattern around three barrels in a triangular arrangement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cowgirl will take a running start on his\/her horse and ride towards the first barrel. At the first barrel, a rider should come at a slight angle. It\u2019s easier on the horse if you don\u2019t come at it straight on. They must make a complete turn around the barrel then race toward the second barrel. At the second barrel, they will again make a complete turn, which means they will make the turn in the opposite direction as the first barrel then accelerate toward the third barrel. At the third barrel they will again make a complete loop in the same direction as the second barrel and then run back across the starting line which also serves as the finish line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Breakaway Roping<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Breakaway roping is a women\u2019s event in professional rodeo and is a variation of tie down roping where a calf is roped, but not thrown and tied. Once the rope is around the calf\u2019s neck, the roper brings the horse to a sudden stop. The rope is tied to the saddle horn with a string. When the calf hits the end of the rope, the rope is pulled tight and the string breaks. The breaking of the string marks the end of the run. The rope usually has a small white flag at the end that makes the moment the rope breaks more easily seen by the judge. The fastest time wins. The rope is usually shorter than a rope used in the tie down roping. The horse\u2019s ability to start quick and stop quick is a must. The winning runs will usually only take one or two seconds depending on the length of the barrier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nebraska&#8217;s Big Rodeo schedule of events<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NBR returns 2022, with main performances expected to start at 7:00 PM each night starting on Wednesday, July 27, and ending on Saturday, July 30.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Wednesday, July 27, 2022<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8 AM: Barrel Racing Slack<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 AM: 4-H Small Animal Show<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noon-5 PM: NBR Museum at Parish Center<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 PM-8 PM: 4-H Exhibit Hall and Open Class Exhibits Open<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 PM-11 PM: NBR General Store Open on Midway (NBR souvenirs and merchandise)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Kids Tractor Pull<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Commercial, Ag Exhibits &amp; Vendors open on the Midway<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Carnival Opens<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6:30 PM-1 AM Bull Pen Beer Garden~~6:30 PM\u2013Performance End\u2026&#8230;West Side Beer Garden<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7:00 PM: NEBRASKA&#8217;S BIG RODEO PERFORMANCE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 PM-12 AM: Finch on the Run (DJ) FCLLA Teen Dance at the dance pavilion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Thursday, July 28, 2022<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8 AM: PRCA Steer Roping<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9 AM: 4-H Livestock Show<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 AM-8 PM: 4-H Exhibit Hall Open<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2:30 PM-5 PM: DAR Quilt Show, High School Commons Room<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 PM-8 PM: Open Class Exhibits Open<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 PM-11 PM: NBR General Store Open on Midway (NBR souvenirs and merchandise)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Commercial, Ag Exhibits &amp; Vendors open on the Midway<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Carnival Opens<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6:30 PM-1 AM: Bull Pen Beer Garden~~6:30 PM\u2013Performance End: West Side Beer Garden<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7:00 PM: NEBRASKA&#8217;S BIG RODEO PERFORMANCE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 PM-1 AM: Prodigal Son in Bull Pen Beer Garden<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 PM-12 AM: Finch on the Run (DJ) FCCLA Teen Dance at the dance pavilion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Friday, July 29, 2022<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9 AM: Timed Event Slack<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9 AM-5 PM: DAR Quilt Show, High School Commons Room<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 AM: 4-H Livestock Swine Show<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>30 minutes after Swine Show: Round Robin for Champion Sr. Showman (Beef, Sheep, Swine, Goats, Horses)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 AM-8 PM: 4-H Exhibit Hall Open<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noon-5 PM: NBR Museum at Parish Center<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noon-11 PM: NBR General Store Open on Midway (NBR souvenirs and merchandise)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 PM-8 PM: Open Class Exhibits Open<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Many Moccasins Indian Dance Troupe on the Midway<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Commercial, Ag Exhibits &amp; Vendors open on the Midway<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Carnival Opens<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6:30 PM: 4-H Parade of Champions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6:30 PM-1 AM: Bull Pen Beer Garden ~~6:30 PM\u2013Performance End: West Side Garden<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7:00 PM: NEBRASKA&#8217;S BIG RODEO PERFORMANCE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 PM-1 AM: Luke Mills in Bull Pen Beer Garden<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 PM-1 AM: Finch on the Run (DJ) FCCLA Teen Dance at the dance pavilion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Saturday, July 30, 2022<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 AM: Rodeo Parade (Downtown)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11 AM-2 PM: DAR Quilt Show, High School Commons Room<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noon-5 PM: NBR Museum at Parish Center<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noon-11 PM: NBR General Store Open on Midway (NBR souvenirs and merchandise)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 PM: Nebraska&#8217;s Little Rodeo<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 PM-7 PM: 4-H Exhibit Hall Open<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 PM: 4-H Livestock Premium Auction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 PM-8 PM: Open Class Exhibits Open<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Many Moccasins Indian Dance Troupe on the Midway<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Commercial, Ag Exhibits &amp; Vendors open on the Midway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 PM: Carnival Opens<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6:30 PM-1 AM: Bull Pen Beer Garden~~6:30 PM\u2013Performance End: West Side Beer Garden<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7:00 PM: NEBRASKA&#8217;S BIG RODEO PERFORMANCE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 PM-1 AM: Dylan Bloom in Bull Pen Beer Garden<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 PM-1 AM: Finch on the Run (DJ) FCCLA Teen Dance at the dance pavilion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The schedule can change as the event nears, and you can stay updated by checking out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nebraskasbigrodeo.com\/schedule-of-events\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nebraska&#8217;s Big Rodeo &#8211; Last Words<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s touch a little bit on how Nebraska&#8217;s Big Rodeo came to happen to date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city&#8217;s people founded a community celebration in Burwell in 1921, and Rodeos were started in the town to reflect its western roots. The first rodeo competition took place at the historical arena of Burwell in September 1921, and since then, nearly every world champion rodeo rider has encountered the arena.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Burwell and NBR, both communities went through a revitalization period in the 1990s and 2000s. Spectators are now flocking to see the annual event, which their parents and grandparents also enjoyed, with the nearby Calamus Lake and the town&#8217;s small-town, rustic appeal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from NBR, the 40-acres ground arena with wooden-covered grandstands and a \u00be miles track also hosts the Garfield County Fair. Both of these competitions are held annually at one of the world&#8217;s largest outdoor rodeo arenas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To read more about the competition (s) or arena, click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nebraskasbigrodeo.com\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nebraska&#8217;s Big Rodeo&#8217;s 100th anniversary drew everyone to Burwell in July 2021.
