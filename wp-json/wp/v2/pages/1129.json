Rodeo fans can enjoy multiple entertainment options before and after the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in the arena this year. You have no excuse for not attending the 2023 NFR in Las Vegas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the payouts for the Cowboys, the PRCA estimates that the event brings in about&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reviewjournal.com\/sports\/rodeo\/national-finals-rodeo\/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-national-finals-rodeo\/\">$90 million annually to the Las Vegas economy<\/a>. Furthermore, recent attendance stats have shown that&nbsp;177,565 rodeo enthusiasts decked out in Wrangler jeans, Justin boots and cowboy hats attended events at the Thomas &amp; Mack with an additional 40,000 fans who watched at the 40 hotels that hosted watch parties. It is during this rare time of the year that many marquees on the Strip have the face of bull riders replacing DJs\u2019 faces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-the-national-finals-rodeo-nfr\"><strong>What is the National Finals Rodeo (NFR)?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can call it the Super Bowl of all rodeos. Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association concludes its season with the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. Each rodeo performance begins with a performance of the national anthem by some notable entertainers. After that, the competition commences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-qualify-to-compete-in-the-national-finals-rodeo\"><strong>How to qualify to compete in the National Finals Rodeo<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PRCA World Standings for the standard rodeo events determine who qualifies for the NFR. The events include Saddle Bronc Riding, Bareback Riding, Team Roping (headers and heelers), Steer Wrestling, Tie-Down Roping, Bull Riding, and WPRA Barrel Racing. A share of the $10.257 million purses and the ultimate PRCA World Championship Gold Buckle will be on the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten rounds make up the National Finals Rodeo. Each contestant competes once a day over the course of each 10 consecutive day period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-the-national-finals-rodeo-winners-are-selected\"><strong>How the National Finals Rodeo Winners are selected<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the NFR competition, two champions are crowned in each event (four in team roping). During the 10 rounds, the first champion is determined by the best average time or score. The Second Champion is the world champion who earned the most money for the year, including NFR winnings. It is important to note that each event&#8217;s average winner and world champion may be the same person or different people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nfr-main-events\"><strong><u>NFR Main Events<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seven main events have historically taken place at the National Finals Rodeo. Each event has its own monetary prizes that are paid out, and those payouts are determined by each top-placing competitor&#8217;s rank in relation to the event&#8217;s overall prize pool. Individuals placed in the top-six of a particular event are paid out accordingly, while individuals placed in the top-eight of the overall NFR are also paid out. The NFR main events are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bareback-riding\"><strong>Bareback Riding<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This consists of a horseback cowboy using bareback rigging as the primary means of staying on top of the horse. This grip has often been compared to the equivalent of hanging on to a suitcase handle and makes for the only support that a cowboy has on top of the wildly bucking horse. An 8-second ride constitutes a qualified ride and the cowboys are judged on riding technique.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"steer-wrestling\"><strong>Steer Wrestling<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This act involves a horseback steer wrestler, alternatively known as a &#8220;bulldogger&#8221;, bringing a fast-moving steer to a halt on its back as fast as possible. The bulldogger utilizes a combination of strength, technique, speed, and precision to jump off of their horse from a designated starting point and onto a steer sprinting off from the same starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"team-roping\"><strong>Team Roping<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><h4><strong>Headers<\/strong><\/h4><p>One of two horseback team members whose job is to successfully rope the head of the steer in one of three tries as fast as possible;&nbsp;around both horns, around one horn and the head, or around the neck.<\/p><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><h4><strong>Heelers<\/strong><\/h4><p>One of two horseback team members whose job is to successfully rope&nbsp;the hind legs of the steer as soon as the header has successfully done their part. To avoid a 5-second penalty for roping only one hind leg, the heeler must rope both hind legs.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"saddle-bronc-riding\"><strong>Saddle Bronc Riding<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to Bareback Riding, the goal of the horseback cowboy is to maintain their balance as much as possible for 8 seconds while the horse is bucking. In this event, however, the cowboy sits on a saddle while using one hand to hold on to a thick rein that&#8217;s attached to the horse&#8217;s halter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tie-down-roping\"><strong>Tie-Down Roping<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This event centers around a cowboy on horseback attempting to restrain a calf by throwing a well-timed rope loop that&#8217;s attached to the cowboy\u2019s horse. The cowboy and the calf both leave from a designated starting point, with the calf getting a slight head start. The cowboy depends on the horse to mitigate any slack in the rope after dismounting, then proceeds to tie up the calf as fast as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"barrel-racing\"><strong>Barrel Racing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a women&#8217;s event where horseback cowgirls race against the clock to complete a strategically set course where barrels are set up as landmarks. The intent is for the cowgirls to complete a cloverleaf-shaped run around 3 barrels placed in a triangular formation as fast as possible. Barrels that are accidentally knocked over result in 5-second penalties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bull-riding\"><strong>Bull Riding<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The cowboy on top of the bull has the main objective of staying on top and maintaining their balance for 8 seconds. They are judged based on technique and can earn extra points by spurring while the bull is bucking. The cowboy stays on top of the bull by grasping a flat braided rope, which also wraps around the bull&#8217;s chest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"all-around-champion\"><strong>All-Around Champion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Being crowned the All-Around Champion speaks volumes about the versatility and high level of talent exhibited by the winning cowboy. &nbsp;In order to receive this honor, the cowboy must have won the most prize money in a given year and competed in at least 2 NFR events while earning at least $3,000 in each of those events. This is widely known as the highest honor bestowed by the PRCA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"contestants\"><strong><u>Contestants<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au\/top-15-qualifiers-for-the-national-finals-rodeo-2017\/\">120 cowboys<\/a> from all over the United States that will step foot as competitors within the NFR.

The event is considered to be so big and consistently sold-out that the UNLV basketball team that normally uses the NFR venue during the season has to annually build its schedule in a way that keeps the team on the road for the duration of the NFR festivities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"miss-rodeo-america\"><strong><u>Miss Rodeo America<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an annual pageant that takes place as part of the general festivities of the NFR.

The winner must also attend rodeos throughout the country and promote the rodeo throughout the subsequent year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Young women have the opportunity to gain a lifetime of experience through the Miss Rodeo America Pageant while laying the foundation for their future endeavors at the same time. Many lifelong friendships are formed in the process, and many doors are opened for all the competitors and for the young lady selected to wear the crown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miss Rodeo America becomes a part of a great legacy, part of history, today, tomorrow, and for generations to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Date: Sunday, November 28, 2023 \u2013 Sunday, December 5, 2023<br>\u2022 Location: South Point Hotel<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cowboy-christmas\"><strong><u>Cowboy Christmas<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those that need a break from the constant adrenaline that comes with the NFR&#8217;s main events, the <a href=\"https:\/\/fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au\/cowboy-christmas\/\">Cowboy Christmas<\/a> experience allows for a welcomed change of pace.
