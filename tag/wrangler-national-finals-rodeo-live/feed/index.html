<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Las Vegas NFR (opens in a new tab)" href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/" target="_blank">Las Vegas NFR</a> is back. It&#8217;s been a long, arduous journey through the <a href="https://www.prorodeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="PRCA (opens in a new tab)">PRCA</a> regular season, but on December 7 it comes to an end. The National Finals Rodeo gears up to turn the city into a hardcore &#8220;Cowboy Town.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Wrangler National Finals Rodeo takes place a 10-day event for the 33rd consecutive year in Las Vegas at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center. The Super Bowl of rodeo features competitions in bareback riding, steer wrestling, team roping, saddle bronc riding, tie-down roping, barrel racing and bull riding, with 20,000 of Western-clad visitors expected to pull for their favorite athletes at the world’s richest rodeo.</p>



<p>The cowboys and barrel racers will kick up dust and pick up more money at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in a quest for gold buckles and glory. Thousands of Western-clad visitors will be the witness with roaring crowds at the world’s richest rodeo.</p>



<p>Each December, Las Vegas goes a little crazy for the country. Cowboys descend on the city and country music abounds when the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo returns.</p>



<p>In addition, fans can enjoy the ProRodeo Zone, the exclusive fan interactive area of the Wrangler NFR. Sponsors provide interactive activities in tents adjacent to the arena. The NFR Sponsor Hotels also have <a href="https://www.la-maison-des-tortues.com/medic/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#333;">Injectable Methandienone</a> interactive tents set up in the NFR Village, on the plaza in front of the arena.</p>



<p>Cowboy Christmas, the longest running and ONLY “original” gift show of the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo boasts over 300,000 square feet of show floor hosting 400 plus vendors from across the United States and Canada. Each year these vendors showcase their unique products which include: customized jewelry, western wear, boots and spurs, furniture, original art, handmade crafts, and pottery.</p>



<p>The San Angelo Roping Fiesta has held a special place in the hearts of thousands of roping fans for well over half a century. Not only is it a time that roping fans look forward to each year, but the Roping Fiesta marks a reunion of the best competitors in the world as a pre-game show to the NFR just a few short weeks behind this event in December.</p>



<p>The shopping will be great with all the vendors at the Cowboy Christmas Gift Show in the coliseum and cattle barn. Vendors will be open 10 a.m.-6:30 Saturday and 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Sunday. If you are looking for a unique gift, this is the place to shop.</p>



<p>Argyle’s nine-year-old Lealond Henderson, whose nickname is Lelo, got into the rodeo business just before his third birthday.</p>



<p>“Actually, Lelo got into rodeo by accident,” Mom Deborah said. “We went for fun and thought he might get a charge out of riding a sheep. For the fun of it he rode a sheep at the North Texas Fair in Denton, got a face full of dirt, but loved the experience.”</p>



<p>Live entertainment by cowboy pickers, singers, songwriters, storytellers and poets will fill each hour on the stage, as visitors stop by to learn more about donating to Help Thy Neighbor and enjoy the variety show.&nbsp;Hopefully some great rodeo film will be shown when loud events from the other arena tend to drown out the musicians.</p>



<p>Workshops and talented artisans will also entertain and wow.</p>



<p>Dec. 8 from 9-5, Bob Park will show onlookers how to draw western floral patterns.</p>



<p>Dec. 9, he will show how to tool leather.</p>



<p>Dec. 10, he will demonstrate leather antiquing, drying and finishing in the morning and then burnishing edges in the afternoon.</p>



<p>Dec. 11 he will present gun leather design and contruction.</p>



<p>Dec. 12, onlookers can learn to make a small leather notebook.</p>



<p>Dec. 13, learn to make a wallet cover.</p>



<p>Dec. 14-15, learn to carve, tool and scuplt orchids.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR), coming up in Las Vegas at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center December 5 – 14, 2019 is the biggest and most prestigious and iconic event in the rodeo road. Las Vegas turns into cowboy and cowgirl town in every December during the National Finals Rodeo and Vegas will be hosting the big event for 2024. It’s a 10 days annual festival and everywhere you look you can see rodeo-related activities. <a href="http://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au">Watch National Finals Rodeo 2019 live stream online</a>.</p>



<p>The most talented PRCA&#8217;s qualifiers cowboy will join Las Vegas and they will make a lot money at the National Finals Rodeo. Professional cowboys and cowgirls perform for a coveted spot in the top 15 of their respective seven different events where $10 million in prize money are given according to their performance.</p>



<p>You need to know 5 things about the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo:</p>



<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>NFR is regarded as &#8220;Super Bowl&#8221; of Rodeo:</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The Wrangler National Finals Rodeo is popularly known as the &#8220;<a href="http://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/"><strong>Super Bowl</strong></a>&#8221; of rodeo. The top 15 of the PRCA seven main events &#8211; tie-down roping, steer wrestling, bull riding, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, barrel racing, and team roping &#8211; standings have a chance to be crowned world champion. Thomas &amp; Mack were full of 178000 rodeo fans and the attendance was more than the previous year. Boyd Polhamus, PRCA’s Announcer of the Year, said “It’s our Super Bowl,” Polhamus continued,“It’s humbling. You realize you are surrounded by the best this industry has to offer in every aspect. From the contestants to the livestock, to the production staff and crew, there are none better anywhere than those who produce it.”</p>



<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>TV broadcasts to bring National Finals Rodeo to millions:</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The CBS Sports Network will broadcast live in the United States. Television viewers can watch NFR on channel 221 on DirecTV, channel 158 on Dish and Channel 333 on Cox Cable. Broadcasts will air from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. ET each 10 night. North Canadian NFR fans can watch on CBS Sports Net carriers Rogers, Bell Aliant, Cogeco, SaskTel, Canadian Cable Systems and Ontario, Inc. Rodeo fans also can enjoy the 10-day event on online stream. Wrangler NFR also live tune in radio broadcast on the ProRodeoLive radio player or SiriusXM Rural Radio Ch-147. This is all I know about TV broadcast for Wrangler National Finals Rodeo 2016.</p>



<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Las Vegas NFR prize money has increased incredibly high:</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Las Vegas starts to host the National Finals Rodeo in 1985 with $1.79 million prize money awarded among the competitors. The new 10-year contract for the NFR at Las Vegas has increased its prize money to $10 million for the participating cowboys and cowgirls. NFR has been held in Vegas over the past 31 years and it has been paid out more than $175 million in prize money to its money winner contestants. NFR also has compensated to all of its stock contractors.</p>



<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Superb service ready to all NFR fans:</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>



<p>National Finals Rodeo is one of the most fan-friendly events than all of the other sports. The nightly satellite feeds are piped into area hotels and casino properties thus all spectaculars can watch what happen in the NFR events. The NFR Express gives their shuttle service free of charge to the rodeo from numerous hotels. NFR fans can enjoy events live for free at more than 40 casinos and hotels whether they can’t get tickets at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center via &#8220;Beyond the Dirt&#8221; satellite feeds. Fans are given bus and hotel amenities on behalf of the NFR Express, a slew of country music concerts, autograph-signings and viewing parties will take place. Don’t forget your hats!</p>



<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Las Vegas turns into cowboy and cowgirl town:</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Wrangler NFR is the season-ending 10 days biggest events and Las Vegas turns into Cowboy (and cowgirl) Town along with the hundreds of thousands of people during the National Finals Rodeo. Everywhere you look you can see cowboys and rodeo-related activities. The whole city decorated in a new shape. You can meet your nicest and friendliest people during the National Finals Rodeo.</p>
