Boyd Polhamus, PRCA’s Announcer of the Year, said “It’s our Super Bowl,” Polhamus continued,“It’s humbling. You realize you are surrounded by the best this industry has to offer in every aspect. From the contestants to the livestock, to the production staff and crew, there are none better anywhere than those who produce it.”</p>
