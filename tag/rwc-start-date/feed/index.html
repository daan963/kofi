<p class="text-align-justify"><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/"><strong>The Sporting News</strong></a> presents the details of the 10th edition of a tournament that was held for the first time in 1987, the year in which the All Blacks became champions on their land.</p>
<h2 class="text-align-justify">When does the 2023 Rugby World Cup start?</h2>
<p class="text-align-justify">The 2023 Rugby World Cup begins on <strong>September 8</strong> at the Stade de France in Paris, with the duel <strong>France vs. New Zealand</strong>. One of the most important classics in the world opens a World Cup that is set to be even and very exciting. The North wants to end the reign of the South and add its second star: England, in 2003, is for the moment the only exception.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">That will be the only match of the first day, which will continue the next day with four other matches: Italy vs. Namibia, Ireland vs. Romania, Australia vs. Georgia, and Argentina vs. England. <strong>The final will be played, again at the Stade de France, on Saturday, October 28.</strong></p>
<h2 class="text-align-justify">How many times has France hosted a Rugby World Cup?</h2>
<p class="text-align-justify">The 2023 Rugby World Cup will be the second time in history that France has hosted a tournament of this type in its history as the main venue. <strong>He previously did so in 2007, the year in which South Africa beat England 15-6 in the final. </strong>However, if it is taken into account that he also received matches in the 1991 and 1999 World Cups, this will be the fourth time on French soil.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">In England in 1991, the organization gave him eight games: there the actions of Group D made up of France, Canada, Romania, and Fiji were played, plus the quarterfinals France vs. England and New Zealand vs. Canada.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Meanwhile, in Wales 1999, there were also eight with the six Group C matches (France, Fiji, Canada, and Namibia) plus Argentina vs. Ireland and South Africa vs. England.</p>
<p><strong>Rugby League World Cup 2023</strong>: All information about the broadcast on free TV or stream as well as the schedule can be found in this article. The 17th Rugby League World Cup was originally scheduled to take place in France.</p>
<h3>Rugby League World Cup 2022 fixtures and schedule</h3>
