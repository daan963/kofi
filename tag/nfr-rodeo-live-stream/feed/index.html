<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Las Vegas NFR (opens in a new tab)" href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/" target="_blank">Las Vegas NFR</a> is back. It&#8217;s been a long, arduous journey through the <a href="https://www.prorodeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="PRCA (opens in a new tab)">PRCA</a> regular season, but on December 7 it comes to an end. The National Finals Rodeo gears up to turn the city into a hardcore &#8220;Cowboy Town.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Wrangler National Finals Rodeo takes place a 10-day event for the 33rd consecutive year in Las Vegas at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center. The Super Bowl of rodeo features competitions in bareback riding, steer wrestling, team roping, saddle bronc riding, tie-down roping, barrel racing and bull riding, with 20,000 of Western-clad visitors expected to pull for their favorite athletes at the world’s richest rodeo.</p>



<p>The cowboys and barrel racers will kick up dust and pick up more money at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in a quest for gold buckles and glory. Thousands of Western-clad visitors will be the witness with roaring crowds at the world’s richest rodeo.</p>



<p>Each December, Las Vegas goes a little crazy for the country. Cowboys descend on the city and country music abounds when the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo returns.</p>



<p>In addition, fans can enjoy the ProRodeo Zone, the exclusive fan interactive area of the Wrangler NFR. Sponsors provide interactive activities in tents adjacent to the arena. The NFR Sponsor Hotels also have <a href="https://www.la-maison-des-tortues.com/medic/" style="text-decoration:none;color:#333;">Injectable Methandienone</a> interactive tents set up in the NFR Village, on the plaza in front of the arena.</p>



<p>Cowboy Christmas, the longest running and ONLY “original” gift show of the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo boasts over 300,000 square feet of show floor hosting 400 plus vendors from across the United States and Canada. Each year these vendors showcase their unique products which include: customized jewelry, western wear, boots and spurs, furniture, original art, handmade crafts, and pottery.</p>



<p>The San Angelo Roping Fiesta has held a special place in the hearts of thousands of roping fans for well over half a century. Not only is it a time that roping fans look forward to each year, but the Roping Fiesta marks a reunion of the best competitors in the world as a pre-game show to the NFR just a few short weeks behind this event in December.</p>



<p>The shopping will be great with all the vendors at the Cowboy Christmas Gift Show in the coliseum and cattle barn. Vendors will be open 10 a.m.-6:30 Saturday and 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Sunday. If you are looking for a unique gift, this is the place to shop.</p>



<p>Argyle’s nine-year-old Lealond Henderson, whose nickname is Lelo, got into the rodeo business just before his third birthday.</p>



<p>“Actually, Lelo got into rodeo by accident,” Mom Deborah said. “We went for fun and thought he might get a charge out of riding a sheep. For the fun of it he rode a sheep at the North Texas Fair in Denton, got a face full of dirt, but loved the experience.”</p>



<p>Live entertainment by cowboy pickers, singers, songwriters, storytellers and poets will fill each hour on the stage, as visitors stop by to learn more about donating to Help Thy Neighbor and enjoy the variety show.&nbsp;Hopefully some great rodeo film will be shown when loud events from the other arena tend to drown out the musicians.</p>



<p>Workshops and talented artisans will also entertain and wow.</p>



<p>Dec. 8 from 9-5, Bob Park will show onlookers how to draw western floral patterns.</p>



<p>Dec. 9, he will show how to tool leather.</p>



<p>Dec. 10, he will demonstrate leather antiquing, drying and finishing in the morning and then burnishing edges in the afternoon.</p>



<p>Dec. 11 he will present gun leather design and contruction.</p>



<p>Dec. 12, onlookers can learn to make a small leather notebook.</p>



<p>Dec. 13, learn to make a wallet cover.</p>



<p>Dec. 14-15, learn to carve, tool and scuplt orchids.</p>
