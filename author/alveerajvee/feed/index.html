<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>History of Miss Rodeo America</strong></h2>



<p>1955 was the first time when the concept of Miss Rodeo America (MRA) was developed under the assistance of International Rodeo Management (IRM). The first pageant at that year was held under the supervision of IRM first president Ray Peterson, Sr from Nevada.</p>



<p>Almost nine women had competed for the title, and Marilyn Scott
was the first woman who becomes the winner at the MRA first location Casper,
Wyoming. She was the first woman who experienced the luxuriousness of this
title for the years 1955 and 1956.</p>



<p>The second president after Ray Peterson was Fran Blomquist who was
from Idaho and served as the president of IRM for three consecutive years 1955,
1956 and 1957.</p>



<p>A total of 63 Miss Rodeo America bags their title since the year it started, and 2022 Miss Rodeo America Pageant will be the battle of Miss Rodeo America title.</p>



<p>Since the year it started, the eligibility of winning this title is based on a number of factors including personality, appearance, and horsemanship.</p>



<p>The winner of MRA gets the price worth $20,000, a crown that fits
on her cowboy hat, scholarships, Justin boots, wrangler apparel, and Montana
Silversmiths Jewelry and Belt buckles.</p>



<p>Besides that, the MRA also enjoys its reigns until the one year completes. They can travel almost 120,000 miles during the time of one year. They also get the opportunity to appear as a guest on local schools of America just to promote the Rodeo sport.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MRA Scholarship Foundation</strong></h2>



<p>Since the start of the Miss Rodeo America competition in 1955, it’s realized that there is a need for scholarships to help the contestant appearing in the event for their education.</p>



<p>1992 was the exact year when the pageant reached another milestone by awarding scholarships worth $30,000 to the contestants. This was the same historical year in the history of MRA for providing more educational dollars in a year more than the past 37 years of pageant journey.</p>



<p>1997 was the time when Miss Rodeo Scholarship foundation was
established to track the distributions of scholarships and to broad this
program on an upper level.</p>



<p>When the foundation was established, the winner for Miss Rodeo
America received the Scholarship price worth $20,000, and $1000 was distributed
among other contestants.</p>



<p>The prize money a winner receives will directly be sent to the
institution where they are going to study.</p>



<p>The scholarship distribution criteria for 2020 provide the same $20,000 to the winner of the Miss Rodeo America pageant. However, the other runners up will get the scholarship grant mentioned below.</p>



<ul><li>The first runner up will get $10,000.</li><li>The second runner up will get $8,000.</li><li>The third runner up will get $6,000.</li><li>While fourth to tenth runner ups will get $4000 to $1,500.</li><li>Those who appear in the contest will get $1,000.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Last Words</strong></h2>



<p>MRA is the biggest platform for women to showcase their talent,
experience the luxurious lifestyle once in their life by winning the title
based on their appearance, personality, and horsemanship. Since the launch of
this event more than 60 women’s have won this title and fulfilled their dreams.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Miss Rodeo America scholarship foundation realized the responsibility to help all the contestants based on their results, and allow them to pursue their education with the scholarships.</p>



<p>The idea was appreciated by the audience, and the event is becoming bigger every year for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Miss Indian Rodeo 2021 is Tigh Livermont of Wanblee, South Dakota. She was crowned during the Indian National Finals Rodeo at the South Point in Las Vegas Oct. 19-23, 2021.</p>



<p>Livermont has been involved with rodeo her whole life, following in her family’s footsteps. Her desire to be a rodeo queen was sparked after meeting an inspiring woman. “When I was six years old, my parents took me to the Black Hills Stock Show, and that’s where I met Selena Ulch Pope [Miss Rodeo America 2005]. The warmth and kindness that she showed to me–I thought ‘That’s what I want to embody. That’s the person I want to be,’” Livermont says.</p>



<p>What Livermont is most looking forward to is traveling and representing her title across the nation this year. She is excited to attend the <a href="https://fd-uat-autopayroll-app.apps.dfes.wa.gov.au/calgary-stampede-live-stream/">Calgary Stampede</a>, visit southwestern states, and especially rodeos closer to home in the Great Plains and Northern Badlands Region. Due to Covid uncertainties, many INFR tour rodeos are not scheduled at this point.</p>



<p>Yet, Livermont would like to represent her title in whatever capacity she is able. Following the lead of Miss Rodeo America, Jordan Tierney–also from South Dakota–she would like to host online classes to teach the basic tenets of becoming a rodeo queen, if she cannot host them in person. “I thought that was a really neat idea: reaching people regardless of her circumstances, and that’s what I want to do, too. Even though I can’t necessarily be there, I still want to help other people,” she says. “I wanted to host clinics for young girls to help get their foot in the door for queening. I hope to start an online queening program that is free to all ages for moms and aspiring rodeo queens, showcasing the basics of it all. I do want to travel a lot, but due to Covid restrictions that may or may not be a possibility, but I will do so to the best of my ability,” she says.</p>



<p>Livermont is steeped in the ranching lifestyle. Having been raised on a ranch on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, she recognizes the values she grew up with. “The ranching and rodeo lifestyle is: helping each other out, learning about hard work, and learning that you have to build your way up and be humble the entire time, and always being grateful for what you are given,” she says.</p>



<p>According to Livermont, the horse she competed on in Vegas during the ambassador competition was named “Núŋpa—which is the Lakota word for ‘two’. He was named this because my brother Henry had two full brother red dun horses—so he named them Waŋží (one) and Núŋpa. Me and Henry traded horses and I’ve had Núŋpa for about 6 or 7 years now,” she says.</p>



<p>Núŋpa started out as a ranch horse but transitioned nicely into the life of a rodeo queen’s horse and helped her to clinch the horsemanship award, as well as her title. The largest and most fun category for Livermont was the horsemanship section. She also won the categories of traditional presentation–where the ladies dressed in traditional regalia and explained the significance of each part–and Miss Congeniality.</p>



<p>Livermont has a passion for serving others. Humility and consideration of others are key values for everyday life, and have translated to success in queening. “I’m proud of… having those virtues of helping others. In our culture, it’s “Wólakȟota”, which is being very peaceful, and “Mitákuye oyásiŋ” is looking out for your other relatives, because we are all related and we all have to help each other. It represents respecting your oyáte (tribe/nation) and a reminder to us that we are all connected and to take care of all of your relatives (two-legged, four-legged, and Mother Earth),” she says.</p>



<p>In 2017, Livermont was Miss Oglala Lakota Nation. She also competed for the titles of Miss Black Hills Stock Show &amp; Rodeo and Miss Black Hills Roundup in the past. “Those were very good learning experiences. I learned what I need to do to tune myself on in order to be a better rodeo queen and shape myself,” she says.</p>



<p>“The number one message I want to spread to people is to be the best version of yourself. The only person you are competing with, not only in the rodeo queen setting but in life, is yourself. Working on your skills, learning how to be the best version of yourself is what I want to spread to others, whether it be in or out of the rodeo arena,” Livermont says.</p>



<p>Preparing to win this title has been a balancing act. Livermont is not only a full-time teller at Security First Bank in Rapid City, but she is also a part-time student at Casper College. After obtaining her Associate’s Degree of Agricultural Business and Sciences, she plans to transfer to Oglala Lakota College to obtain her Bachelors in Business Management. “Having the experience in the banking industry, I hope to be a loan officer for the agricultural community one day, and be an advocate for them,” she says.</p>



<p>South Dakota and surrounding states were well represented at the INFR. “All athletes—both two and four legged—really proved how strong rodeo in Indian Country really is. It was awesome to witness multiple South Dakota cowboys and cowgirls work the arena and even have a few walk away with world titles,” Livermont says.</p>

<p>Garrett Shadbolt accomplished a lifelong goal this season and that was qualifying for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas this December.</p>



<p>Now his focus shift towards another goal, this weekend at the RAM Prairie Circuit Finals in Duncan, Okla. Shadbolt will look to repeat as the bareback riding champ.</p>



<p>Last season he won both rounds and the average, finishing with 163 points on two head. He&#8217;s excited to return to Oklahoma this year with an opportunity to get his 2022 season rolling.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty dang excited to get down there, so far in my career I&#8217;ve always had really good luck in Duncan,&#8221; said&nbsp;Shadbolt, 25. &#8220;A lot of those guys in the Prairie Circuit are close friends, so it&#8217;ll be good to catchup with them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shadbolt finished 10th in the PRCA | RAM World Standings in 2021. He credits the money he won in Duncan and at the National Circuit Finals Rodeo for putting him in that position.</p>



<p><a href="https://prorodeo.com/standings"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">RELATED: PRCA | RAM World Standings</span></strong></a></p>



<p>&#8220;One of the main reasons I gun to make the circuit finals is because the money counts for the next season,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had a great circuit finals last year and a great RAM National Circuit Finals and that&#8217;s what I needed to get me hot. It really made a difference in me qualifying for the Finals. If the strategy works you keep doing it.&#8221;</p>



<p>And he plans to use this rodeo to knock off some rust in preparation for the NFR.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mini NFR for me, the only difference is it&#8217;s three head versus 10 head,&#8221; Shadbolt said. &#8220;A guy needs to go down there and knock off a little bit of rust. I&#8217;ve been home for a couple weeks now, but hopefully this will sharpen me up and get me ready for the Finals.&#8221;</p>



<p>The three-day championship event will kick off on Thursday, Oct. 14 and crown winners on Saturday, Oct. 16. The action will stream live on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cowboychannelplus.com/"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">PRCA on The Cowboy Channel Plus App</span></strong></a>&nbsp;at 8:30 p.m. ET nightly.</p>



<p>Here is the complete list of last year&#8217;s winner at the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://prorodeo.com/result/2020/ram-prairie-circuit-finals/10648"><strong>2020 RAM Prairie Circuit Finals</strong></a>.</span></p>

<p>The PRCA is excited to announce the selections for the 2021 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo photographers.</p>



<p>The in-arena photographers will be Phil Doyle and Rod Connor.</p>



<p>The behind-the scenes photographers are Clay Guardipee and Roseanna Sales.</p>

<p>Click Thompson will shoot the National Finals Steer Roping at the Kansas Star Arena in Mulvane, Kan., Nov. 12-13. It will be his first time shooting the NFSR.</p>



<p>Shooting the Wrangler NFR or the NFSR is one of the most prestigious honors a ProRodeo photographer can receive.</p>



<p>Doyle will be shooting in the arena at the NFR for the second time, the first in 2018. He also shot behind the scenes in 2017.</p>



<p>Connor will be making his first appearance at the NFR. He photographed the NFSR in 2020.</p>



<p>Guardipee and Sales were both photographers at the Wrangler NFR in 2020 in Arlington, Texas.</p>



<p>This will be the third consecutive NFR that Guardipee has photographed. Sales will also be making her third appearance as an NFR photographer, having shot in 2017 (behind the scenes) and 2020 (in the arena).</p>

<p>SALINAS, Calif. – <a rel="smarttag" rev="16036" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/curtis-cassidy/16036">Curtis Cassidy</a> is 42 years old and obviously age is just a number to the veteran steer wrestler.</p>



<p>The Donalda, Alberta, cowboy is on the cusp of qualifying for his eighth Wrangler National Finals Rodeo after winning the first round at the ProRodeo Tour Finale at California Rodeo Salinas with a 5.3-second run.</p>



<p>Cassidy made his run Thursday night and it held as the top time after the second batch of competitors finished the first round Friday night.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got a real good start, and I was using <a rel="smarttag" rev="18651" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/tanner-milan/18651">Tanner Milan&#8217;s</a> horse, Eddie,&#8221; Cassidy said. &#8220;And, it all came together.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cassidy owns Tyson, a standout horse, but he took him back to Canada to compete on him&nbsp;in rodeos there. He then rode Eddie, 9, at Cheyenne (Wyo.) Frontier Days and the Pendleton (Ore.) Round-Up and now in Salinas.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eddie really works well at the rodeos I have been riding him,&#8221; Cassidy said. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely unique competing in Salinas. You have to run them way the heck out there. The good part is you have a good head of steam when you catch them. It&#8217;s fun once you catch them, but it is a little hairy waiting to get there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;My steer didn&#8217;t run really hard and let me catch him and get my feet on the ground. That&#8217;s what you want here is steer who waits on you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cassidy entered the ProRodeo Tour Finale 14th in the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $59,082. He earned $2,300 for winning the first round at the ProRodeo Tour Finale.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is the crunch time part of the year and I&#8217;m tickled pink to win the first round (in Salinas),&#8221; Cassidy said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ProRodeo Tour Finale continues Saturday at 1 p.m. (PDT) with the second round and concludes Sept. 26 with an eight-man semifinal round and a four-man sudden-death finals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cowboys in the top 24 of the ProRodeo Tour standings qualified for the ProRodeo Tour Finale. The ProRodeo Tour Finale will pay out $1 million to contestants and other PRCA members right before the PRCA regular season ends Sept. 30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I travel with guys who are younger in <a rel="smarttag" rev="18651" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/tanner-milan/18651">Tanner Milan</a>, <a rel="smarttag" rev="93144" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/jesse-brown/93144">Jesse Brown</a> and Scott Guenther and they keep me motivated to keep going,&#8221; Cassidy said. &#8220;I would love to get back to Las Vegas. That would be amazing. I&#8217;m knocking on the door right now and hopefully I can pull through.&#8221;</p>

<p>The early half of the 2021 season wasn&#8217;t going well for steer wrestler <a rel="smarttag" rev="76561" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/tristan-martin/76561">Tristan Martin</a>.</p>



<p>As winter gradually became spring, the 25-year-old from Sulphur, La., realized he needed a change. If he wanted to get things rolling and possibly have a shot at making the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo he needed to shake things up.</p>



<p>Enter <a rel="smarttag" rev="20583" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/hunter-cure/20583">Hunter Cure</a> and <a rel="smarttag" rev="70619" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/cade-staton/70619">Cade Staton</a>. Martin asked if he could jump in their rig and travel with them.</p>



<p>Cure is a five-time NFR qualifier and a two-time PRCA World Champion. Staton has been competing in ProRodeo since 2012. He also has some good horses.</p>



<p>Since jumping in with those two, Martin&#8217;s season has taken off. Entering the Pendleton Round-Up he <em>was</em> the bubble, sitting 15th in the <a href="https://prorodeo.com/standings"><strong>PRCA | RAM World Standings</strong></a>, trying to hold off <a rel="smarttag" rev="72979" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/cody-devers/72979">Cody Devers</a> by less than $200.</p>



<p>Martin got to work early in Pendleton. He split the win in the first round with a time of 4.5 seconds to earn $3,355. His time of 6.8 in the second round has him in the lead in the average with 11.3 seconds on two head heading into Saturday&#8217;s finals.</p>



<p><a href="http://prorodeo.com/news/2021/9/17/general-kincade-henrys-quest-for-first-nfr-makes-a-stop-in-pendleton"><strong>RELATED: </strong></a><strong><a rel="smarttag" rev="99795" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/kincade-henry/99795">Kincade Henry</a> makes finals in Pendleton</strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s continued a successful run for Martin over the last few months</p>



<p>&#8220;This fourth quarter has been great for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everything&#8217;s just clicking and rolling right along. … I started riding <a rel="smarttag" rev="70619" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/cade-staton/70619">Cade Staton&#8217;s</a> horse and started winning. And Hunter is a great person to be around. We have a lot of fun and it&#8217;s straight business. … He (Hunter) is a great mentor and I&#8217;m thankful to be around him.&#8221;</p>



<p>While his first run felt great, his second one was a bit shaky. Nothing to sneeze at on the infield grass in the Pendleton arena.</p>



<p>&#8220;My first run was real good, obviously placing in the first round,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;My second round, a bunch of stuff happened – I got a bad start and it went bad real quickly. But it came together at the end. It all worked out.&#8221;</p>



<p>While Martin is battling to hold onto a berth for the Wrangler NFR (it would be his first), his traveling mate Cure is also hoping to rally late and grab a spot. Cure is 20th in the standings, about $5,000 behind Martin.</p>



<p>After Pendleton, Martin is planning on hitting Albuquerque, N.M., Sunday, and Amarillio, Texas, and the ProRodeo Tour Finale next week.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such an adrenaline rush, right now,&#8221; Martin said about being in the NFR hunt. &#8220;You&#8217;re nervous at the same time, but in the end you can&#8217;t let the nerves get to you. You have to keep nodding your head and you hope for the best.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the average leader, Martin will be out last in Saturday&#8217;s finals. He&#8217;ll be checking the standings overnight and might spend time thinking about what he has to do and running numbers, but when he backs into the box aboard Staton&#8217;s horse FedEx, all those thoughts go out the window.</p>



<p>&#8220;The pressure is always in the back of your mind,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But as professionals, we just deal with pressure, that&#8217;s how we work. If you win, you make money. If you don&#8217;t win, you don&#8217;t make any money. So the pressure, I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s not there, but it is. But you just keep going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearly a year of rodeoing is in the books and it&#8217;s time to name the PRCA Xtreme Bulls Tour champion presented by Pendleton Whisky.</p>
<p>The top 24 bull riders in the world will battle it out in Pendleton, Ore., Sept. 13-14, for a big payday and the coveted Xtreme Bulls Tour title.</p>
<p>Six-time PRCA World Champion <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/sage-kimzey/71715" rel="smarttag" rev="71715">Sage Kimzey</a> and PRCA | RAM World Standings leaders powers the charge into Pendleton. He also sits atop the Xtreme Bulls Tour standings, with $95,291. He&#8217;s excited for the opportunity that the Xtreme Bulls Tour Finale provides in the final month of the season.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an event that a guy wants to win every year, I mean the world standings directly coincide with Xtreme Bulls standings for the most part,&#8221; said Kimzey, 27. &#8220;So, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always really focused on in my career. I&#8217;ve been pretty fortunate over the years in this (Xtreme Bulls), so a Tour title would mean a lot for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kimzey, who has won the Xtreme Bulls Tour title a record four times in 2015, 2017, 2018-2019, won&#8217;t be the only cowboy vying for acclaim at the two-day event. Last year&#8217;s PRCA Xtreme Bulls champion <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/josh-frost/72912" rel="smarttag" rev="72912">Josh Frost</a> is back in the field. A change in the finale&#8217;s competition format has Frost more than up for the challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;In past years it&#8217;s always just been one long round and a short round, this year they&#8217;ve made it a four header,&#8221; said Frost, 26. &#8220;So, it&#8217;s going to be crucial to take it one bull at a time and I&#8217;m willing to bet the guy who gets four bulls rode is going to come out on top.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.cowboychannelplus.com/"><strong>WATCH: On The Cowboy Channel and PRCA on Cowboy Channel Plus App</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The money available at the finale is unreal and it&#8217;s a great opportunity. No matter what position you&#8217;re sitting in it&#8217;s going to have a big impact on the world standings by the end of the week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Tour Finale begins at 11 p.m. (EDT) Monday night on The Cowboy Channel and PRCA on Channel Plus App with two rounds. On Sept. 14 , there will be a third long-go and a progressive round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pendleton is a place that&#8217;s just seeping in tradition, and you know coming over for the Xtreme Bulls finals it&#8217;s going to be a dang good event,&#8221; Kimzey said. &#8220;I&#8217;m pumped for sure; I mean this is what we all look forward to all year, and that&#8217;s a shot at the finale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coming off a win at the Lewiston (Idaho) Roundup, steer wrestler <a rel="smarttag" rev="96383" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/dylan-schroeder/96383">Dylan Schroeder</a> is feeling hopeful about the last few weeks of his season.</p>



<p>And he said he has his friends&#8217; horse, Pepp, to thank for the 3.8-second victory.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was riding Gabe and <a rel="smarttag" rev="97993" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/gavin-soileau/97993">Gavin Soileau&#8217;s</a> horse (Pepp). He&#8217;s good in the box so I knew he was going to let me take the start I wanted to, and after that it all kind of just fell into place,&#8221; Schroeder said.</p>



<p>Having a good horse on the road with him has made all the difference. Now, Schroeder can focus on his mindset and leave the rest up to Pepp.</p>



<p>&#8220;(Riding Pepp) lets me just focus on the steer wrestling part of it and go into every rodeo like it&#8217;s the last one and go for it,&#8221; said Schroeder, who earned $3,387 in Lewiston.</p>



<p>This is Schroeder&#8217;s second season on the ProRodeo circuit, bringing a noticeable difference in his mindset and performance. He&#8217;s already more than doubled last year&#8217;s earnings and has his eyes on the ProRodeo Tour Finale, set for Sept. 23-26 in Salinas, Calif.</p>



<p>With only a few rodeos left on his schedule, and needing to pick up points, a win in Lewiston was valuable. He entered the weekend 48th in the standings on the ProRodeo Tour presented by Pendleton Whisky.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re right on the edge of getting in the Tour Finale, so hopefully we get in there. (I have to) do well at Pendleton (Ore.) and Albuquerque (N.M.),&#8221; Schroeder said. &#8220;We&#8217;re in Puyallup (Wash.) tonight. We went a little long to get into the short round, but we&#8217;ll get some Tour points which will be good.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hopefully we can sneak in this Tour finale.&#8221;</p>



<p>The check from Lewiston will be Schroeder&#8217;s first since the Caldwell (Idaho) Night Rodeo Aug. 17-21. Before the win, Schroeder was 26th in the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $38,774.</p>



<p>Though he admits the last week or so has been slow, Schroeder said he&#8217;s gotten used to battling through the highs and lows of the long season.</p>



<p>This season has been especially competitive, said Schroeder, making it even more difficult to be a consistent money winner.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just been kind of a slow grind,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You get in slumps, and you just have to know that you belong and just wait until you draw a good one and capitalize on it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Schroeder is hoping for more steers like his in Lewiston and more opportunities to capitalize on. His goal for the remainder of the season is to stay hot.</p>



<p>&#8220;(A win) feels good coming into the end of the year too because I&#8217;m trying to fight to the end, get right inside the top 20,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That would be good at the end right here, get on a hot streak going into Pendleton and Albuquerque, finish the year off strong.&#8221;</p>



<p>Other winners at the $138,367 rodeo were bareback rider <a rel="smarttag" rev="21487" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/caleb-bennett/21487">Caleb Bennett</a> (87 points on Sankey Pro Rodeo &amp; Phenom Genetics&#8217; Shoutin Shoes); team ropers Chad Masters/<a rel="smarttag" rev="21803" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/joseph-harrison/21803">Joseph Harrison</a> (4.2 seconds); saddle bronc rider <a rel="smarttag" rev="93520" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/ryder-wright/93520">Ryder Wright</a> (88.5 points on Sankey Pro Rodeo &amp; Phenom Genetics&#8217; Pendleton Roundup&#8217;s Marquee); tie-down ropers <a rel="smarttag" rev="52690" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/shane-hanchey/52690">Shane Hanchey</a> and <a rel="smarttag" rev="21559" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/adam-gray/21559">Adam Gray</a> (8.6 seconds each); barrel racer <a rel="smarttag" rev="76104" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/amanda-welsh/76104">Amanda Welsh</a> (16.92 seconds); steer roper <a rel="smarttag" rev="12080" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/thomas-smith/12080">Thomas Smith</a> (21.6 seconds on two head); and bull riders <a rel="smarttag" rev="91615" href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/roscoe-jarboe/91615">Roscoe Jarboe</a> (88.5 points on Macza Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Lap Dance) and Trey Benton III (88.5 points on Macza Pro Rodeo&#8217;s Ols Tubs Riggs).</p>

<p>Tie-down roper <a href="https://prorodeo.com/bio/contestant/cory-solomon/53598" rel="smarttag" rev="53598">Cory Solomon</a> is coming off a stretch where he placed at just one rodeo over the course of three weeks, but it looks like his luck might be changing at the Washington State Fair Pro Rodeo.<br /> <br />He put together an 8.0-second run on Sept. 9 to take the early lead in Puyallup. He credits his turn around in the Pacific Northwest to his young, up and coming horse.<br /> <br />&#8220;My No. 1 horse (Brazil) has been a little sore as of late, so I decided to put my younger horse (Cisco) on the trailer as my No. 1,&#8221; said Solomon, 31. &#8220;I knew he was a good horse, I just didn&#8217;t know he&#8217;d end up being that good.&#8221;<br /> <br />Solomon is sitting comfortably inside the Top 15 of the PRCA | RAM World Standings at sixth with $96,825.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – ProRodeo Hall of Fame saddle bronc rider Clint Johnson has been named the 2021 Legend of ProRodeo.<br /><br />Johnson will be honored at the <a href="https://www.prorodeohalloffame.com/nfr-events/"><strong>14th annual Wrangler Gold Buckle Gala</strong></a> on Nov. 29 at 6 p.m. (PT) at the South Point Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.<br /><br />&#8220;I just found this news out, and it is pretty exciting,&#8221; said Johnson, 65. &#8220;I absolutely did not think this was an option for me. This is quite an honor. There&#8217;s been a list of prominent people who have received this honor, and I&#8217;m quite excited to be among them. I would like to thank the selection committee for choosing me, and I&#8217;m looking forward to a fun event.&#8221;<br /><br />Johnson began his rodeo career at age 10, and his smooth, consistent style of riding saddle bronc horses led to 11 consecutive qualifications for the National Finals Rodeo from 1979-89. In those 11 career NFR trips he won four world championships (1980, 1987-89) and finished no worse than sixth in the world standings. He also won the NFR average in 1989.<br /><br />&#8220;When you think of legends, you think of greatness. When you think of legends in rodeo, you think of those that accomplished greatness both inside and outside the rodeo arena,&#8221; said Kent Sturman, Director of the ProRodeo Hall of Fame. &#8220;Clint Johnson is a four-time world champion and achieved an overwhelming amount of greatness in the rodeo arena throughout his career, starting in 4-H rodeo, continuing through high school and college rodeo and during his tenure in professional rodeo. And Clint is one of those cowboys who has demonstrated greatness outside of the arena, continually giving back to a sport that he loves by serving on boards, conducting schools and clinics, and providing his expertise to many programs and events throughout rodeo. He was an obvious choice as this year&#8217;s Legend of ProRodeo.&#8221;<br /><br />Johnson was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1992 in Colorado Springs, Colo.<br /><br />&#8220;None of these honors, like the Legend of ProRodeo and being in the ProRodeo Hall of Fame, are expected,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;Going through my career I tried to stay under the radar, but the Legend of ProRodeo is a great honor to be recognized by members of the organization and my peers.&#8221;<br /><br />Johnson, who spent four years on the PRCA Board of Directors serving as vice chairman, was born in Spearfish, S.D. Johnson lived there until moving to the Amarillo, Texas, area where he has lived since 1988.<br /><br />&#8220;Rodeo is the No. 1 sport in South Dakota,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;It was the thing to do when I was growing up. We all wanted to be cowboys, and we all wanted to be bronc riders. I was lucky enough to live that dream. I kept my goals pretty simple and tried to make the best ride I could every time. I wasn&#8217;t worried about winning rodeos.
