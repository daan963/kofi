<p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time">November 23, 2023</time> by <span class="entry-author"><a href="index.html" class="entry-author-link" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name">Linda Purl</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="../../the-rugby-world-cup-and-the-fallacy-of-authority/index.html#respond">Leave a Comment</a></span> </p></header><div class="entry-content"><p>In each edition of the Rugby World Cup, the deception is repeated. Since??<em>rugby</em> was invented in England, it has been my favorite. Or Ireland, which in this edition started as number one in the <em>ranking</em>.??Or France, which is??the organizer this year and the eternal candidate. But there is a slight drawback, as in the fallacy of authority:??<em>rugby</em>??is from the south.??Rugby turns the??<em>map</em>??upside down.??The southern hemisphere is above the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>On Saturday the 28th, the final of the tenth Rugby World Cup will be played at the Stade de France, St. Denis, Paris. It doesn&#8217;t matter where it is held (there have been five editions in Europe, one in Japan, and four in the southern hemisphere), when it is played (starting in May or October), how many countries participate (16 teams in the first World Cup or 20 in the latest editions). The result becomes stubbornly in favor of the southern teams.</p>
<h2 id="h-mundial-de-rugby-de-los-nativos-a-los-wallabies" class="wp-block-heading">Rugby World Cup: from the &#8216;natives&#8217; to the &#8216;wallabies&#8217;</h2>
<p>There were several attempts to organize the tournament until finally, in 1987, the fight for the world rugby throne was staged. There were already frequent top-level international tournaments, such as the old 3 Nations (among the best in the south) or the 5 Nations (for the Europeans). The sport that was born in England, at least as we know it now, taught the world on that first occasion a challenging and demanding practice that, on the other hand, was strictly respectful of the rules, the referees, and the rivals. &#8220;He taught the world&#8221; is an intentional exaggeration because they saw it on television in only 17 countries, compared to the global coverage achieved 20 years later.</p>
<p>And this explosion popularized another wonderful part of the national teams of this sport: each country has a nickname that defines them. New Zealanders were initially known as &#8216;the natives.&#8217; A <em>Daily Mail</em> reporter described his already exceptional game &#8220;as if they were all backs,&#8221; which in English is &#8216;<em>all backs. &#8216;</em>??But the poor telephone transmission of 1903 turned them into??<em>All Blacks. Since</em> then, it has been an appeal to their brilliant style of play along with the color of their shirt, the fern that symbolizes them, and the haka, a traditional Maori warrior dance with which they open the curtain at matches.??In 1908, the Australians adopted the nickname??<em>wallabies</em> after the marsupial, smaller than a kangaroo, agile, and fast, as marked by the tradition of their game. Their European rivals were <em>Los del Gallo</em>??for France and??<em>15 de la Rosa</em>??for England.</p>
<p>The exoticism accompanying the All Blacks did not distract from their winning instinct or their ability to reach the first world title in a final against France, heir to a colorful and virtuous game, champagne rugby<em>.??</em>And since then, New Zealanders have proven up to three times that they are the best at almost everything. Since their first match in 1884, they have exhibited speed, quickness, colorful play, and precision. They have also been the only ones to be crowned twice in a row, although their charisma was not enough for it to be in the first two editions of the World Cup. Australia took over in 1991 with its ability to compete enough to beat England.</p>
<h2 id="h-el-hemisferio-sur-que-brillo-tras-el-92-con-sudafrica" class="wp-block-heading">The southern hemisphere shone after 92 with South Africa</h2>
<p>Thus, the southern hemisphere had already gone 2-0 ahead of the north. The sample was small, it is true. It&#8217;s something that could happen. The hope of the European teams was maintained in the following tournaments.</p>
<p>But the best team had yet to join, the Springboks: South Africa. Since 1977, meetings with the team representing a country noted for its racial discrimination began to be limited. Between 1985 and 1991, he did not play a single??<em>test match</em> (test match in Spanish), which refers to international games played between senior teams, as long as the rugby federations recognize them<i>. Although</i> they are not in competition, they influence world <em>rankings</em>.</p>
<p>With the end of??<em>apartheid</em>, they were readmitted to international tournaments in 1992. They had already missed two world tournaments, and South Africa hosted the 1995 World Cup. It was the first international sporting competition it hosted after the end of the shameful segregation system. <em>They had competed so tiny that there were no accurate references to how the Boks</em> (as they are also known, <em>the Bokke,</em>??or even??<em>the AmaBokoBoko)</em> would behave.??They were the ninth favorites.</p>
<p>The new government headed by Nelson Mandela thought it would be an excellent way to present the rainbow country. It rallied popular support beyond race under the slogan: &#8220;One team, one country.&#8221; With a government behind it, the team confirmed in an epic way that they could overcome very adverse situations in sports, reflecting what they could do as a society. In addition to being favorites in the final, the All Blacks had the best player in the world, Jonah Lomu. It was insufficient, and South African captain Francois Pienaar lifted the Webb Ellis Cup.</p>
<h2 id="h-el-mundial-de-2023-no-es-solo-rugby" class="wp-block-heading">The 2023 World Cup is not &#8220;just rugby.&#8221;</h2>
<p>In the semi-final against England in this 2023 edition, on Saturday, October 21, it had passed half past ten at night, and they were about to be left out. But we have seen that hundreds of times. South Africa &#8220;only&#8221; knows <em>rugby</em> and a faith that moves the rival forwards. They trail behind the entire game, sometimes dramatically. Little by little, they harden, come together, push a little more, change nuances, and drag in a scrum. And in that moment, still far away on the scoreboard, they know they will win. This year&#8217;s motto is &#8220;<em>Stronger Together,&#8221;</em> translated as &#8220;Together we are stronger.&#8221; And they have left no doubt. These days, some chronicles in the southern country talk about how it has become a constant that a group of heroes saves South Africa from disaster.</p>
<p>The description seems to be &#8220;just <em>rugby</em>,&#8221; but it is not. In Japan&#8217;s previous 2019 Rugby World Cup, they had to overcome disagreements that led to the return of racist episodes, even within the team. If in his first World Cup, there was only one black player, Chester Williams, one of the protagonists at that time, the first black captain in Bokke history stood out, Siya Kolisi. Shortly before the competition, Eben Etzeberth, a white man of Afrikaner origin and a national icon, had been accused of assaulting and racially insulting a beggar.</p>
<p>Kolisi refused to take a position in the controversy in a rarefied atmosphere. In South Africa, it was questioned whether there was unity among those called up while a??<em>de facto</em> separation was slipping between white and black players.??And they won, again, to win the title, this time against England in the most comfortable final they have played to date.</p>
<p>This year, we reached the tenth edition. Except for the fifth match held in Australia in 2003, which England won spectacularly and miraculously against the hosts, nations in the southern hemisphere won the Rugby World Cup. We already know it will be like that this time, too, because the All Blacks and Springboks, New Zealand and South Africa, will decide who becomes the four-time champion first. Both return to their essence, reminding the world that it doesn&#8217;t matter how we think they are or their position in the <em>ranking</em>. Each of them dominates all the moments of the game, and before starting October, they knew that they would most likely reach the final. And it is the best possible ending.</p>
<p>PS This is Neutral, and we always look at women&#8217;s sports. And yes, in the Women&#8217;s Rugby World Cup, the southern hemisphere is also ahead: New Zealand has six out of nine contested titles. In 2025, we will tell the outcome of the tenth edition in England.</p>

<p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time">November 6, 2023</time> by <span class="entry-author"><a href="index.html" class="entry-author-link" rel="author"><span class="entry-author-name">Linda Purl</span></a></span> <span class="entry-comments-link"><a href="../../rugby-world-cup-opponents-and-challenges-for-the-japanese-team/index.html#respond">Leave a Comment</a></span> </p></header><div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The 2023 Rugby World Cup will start on September 8 in France. The Japanese team, which reached the quarterfinals for the first time in the previous edition of the competition, has been improving its game with its sights set on victory under the direction of head coach Jamie Joseph. Can Japan, which is part of the High-Performance Union with the rest of the best countries in this sport, surprise the world again?</p></blockquote>
<h2>Objective: from the quarterfinals to victory</h2>
<p>Rugby fever broke out in the Japanese archipelago in the autumn of 2019. It was the first time that the World Cup was held in the country and in Asia. The national team won group A of the first division, winning all four games and defeating teams as powerful as Ireland and Scotland, thanks to which they reached the quarterfinals for the first time in history.</p>
<p>The One Team, captained by the New Zealander Michael Leitch and made up of players from various origins (Australia, South Africa, Tonga, Samoa, South Korea, etc.), conquered the hearts of the fans, becoming a model of respect for diversity that It&#8217;s so in vogue right now. According to organizers, 50,000 people gathered to watch the parade that took place after the tournament in Marunouchi, a neighbourhood in central Tokyo. The national rugby team left a notable impact as an entity that transcends the world of sport.</p>
<p>Four years have passed since that. We are back in World Cup year. Japan faces this edition from a different position than the one it occupied. His first quarterfinal, which he won in 2019, is no longer an achievement but a quota to meet. The first to have publicly proclaimed it are the players themselves, who have declared that they are going for the title on multiple occasions since the training camp began, less than three months before the competition.</p>
<p>Will there be those who call it bragging? So far the winners of the Rugby World Cup have been New Zealand and South Africa on three occasions each, Australia on two and England on one; nobody else. But the players of the Japanese team do not talk just to talk. At the training camp, they began on June 12 in Urayasu (Chiba Prefecture), they were heard commenting that it was the hardest training they had done to date, referring to the tackling practice they underwent every morning during an hour in a tent set up in a corner of the field.</p>
<p>The program of John Donahue, a specialist in jujutsu and other martial arts, and a seasoned coach in the Australian 13-a-side rugby league, consists of almost an hour straight of repeated tackling and contact, without breaks to rest or hydrate. During the intervals, a co-responsibility system is followed in which the entire team is penalized if one of the players shows a ???weak posture???, such as resting their hands on their knees, hips or on their head. It is a training with a spartan approach that could be considered anachronistic from a security and regulatory compliance point of view.</p>
<p>???If we want to win a world competition, we cannot afford to lose in contact,??? argues national team director Fujii Y??ichir?? to justify the objective of the special training. In 2019, the Japanese ranked among the top eight teams by adapting their strategy to the opponent, with a versatile offence that used sophisticated attacks and deployed carefully designed scrums. However, in the quarterfinals, they suffered a complete defeat against South Africa, who ended up winning the title. They needed to become players with a robust physique who could endure the month and a half of hand-to-hand combat without getting worn out and reach the end of the marathon in top shape.</p>
<h2>The evolution of the national team in four years</h2>
<p>In the world of rugby, there is an almost protocol hierarchy. Every year the European teams from the Six Nations (England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy) and the four southern hemisphere powers that compete in the Rugby Championship (New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina) form Tier 1 ( tier means &#8216;level&#8217;), a group that enjoys priority in matchmaking, among other aspects. On the other hand, Japan, the so-called island countries (Fiji, Samoa and Tonga) and Europeans outside the six mentioned above (such as Georgia or Romania) are relegated to Tier 2 and rarely play against those from the first in test matches.</p>
<p>For the Japanese team to expand its experience, create a solid squad and increase its competitive capacity in the context of rugby&#8217;s inflexible structure, the opportunities for it to face the best must be multiplied. Reaching the quarterfinals in the 2019 World Cup should have been the springboard to achieve it, but starting in 2020, international matches began to be cancelled due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>So, Japan hasn&#8217;t improved at all in these years? It is a question that offers two answers. The Japanese suffered a resounding defeat in the first match against France (23 to 42) but managed to finish 15 to 20 in the second, in July 2022, while, in October, they finished 31 to 38 against New Zealand. The fact that they managed to come back &#8211; even if they didn&#8217;t win &#8211; on just one occasion or were so close to turning the score around against two of the best in the world shows how they have improved their level.</p>
<p>Twenty-year-old Warner Dearns, who plays on the second line and transferred from Ry??ts?? Keizai University&#8217;s Kashiwa High School team to Brave Lupus Tokyo, scored a goal against his native New Zealand team. And Kobe Steelers flyhalf Lee Seung-sin, 21, led the game against France.</p>
<p>In 2023 Osada Tomoki, a Saitama Wild Knights centre who won the League One Rookie of the Year award, and Fukui Sh??ta, who joined the same team after finishing high school and is now in his fifth year, will also make their national team debuts. The development of these young people is rapidly fueling the power of the national team.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it must be taken into account that the national team has not won a single match against a top-level team since the 2019 Rugby World Cup. A probable cause is the disappearance of the Sunwolves, that is, the lack of reinforcement. The Sunwolves, made up of candidates for the Japanese national team, were formed to compete in Super Rugby, and since 2016 they have played games almost weekly against New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina to gain experience, but they ceased their activity in 2020, in part. due to the influence of the pandemic.</p>
<p>League One, which grew out of the Top League in 2022, attracts more stars from other countries and holds more matches than before, but head coach Jamie Joseph points out: ???It has nothing to do with how tough the teams are. matches against foreign teams.??? In November 2022, the team toured Europe and lost 13-52 against England, who will be in the same group at the World Cup. They were also defeated by France 17-35 on opposing territory, despite being just 5 points behind when they met in Tokyo in July. The truth is that it has not yet reached the point of being able to compete consistently against the first teams.</p>
<h2>The maturation of Japanese rugby</h2>
<p>All in all, Japan&#8217;s position in the world of rugby has changed. In May 2023, World Rugby announced that it was recognizing him as a member of the High Performance Union (HPU). Thus, it becomes one of eleven components of the union, along with the 10 that make up Tier 1 . However certain media outlets were quick to announce that Japan had entered Tier 1.</p>
<p>The HPU, in reality, is an association with recognized solvency in every sense, from the results accumulated by the powerful teams in each category (men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rugby 15 and 7) to regulatory compliance and financing. As Iwabuchi Kensuke, CEO of the Japan Rugby Football Union, says: ???It&#8217;s not just about the talent of the national team&#8217;s players.??? World Rugby itself is disassociating itself from the exclusive tiering classification. Japan has earned recognition as a member with a mature rugby culture that does not depend on whether it loses or wins on the field at any given time.</p>
<p>Despite everything, the men&#8217;s rugby 15s World Cup continues to be a showcase where the global capacity of each country is exposed.</p>
<p>???In Japanese rugby, the style of play changes depending on the opponent. ???It surprised me,??? declared Pieter Labuschagn?? in 2018, when he was playing with the Sunwolves. The South African flanker participated in the 2019 World Cup. While the Europeans try to dominate the opponent with set pieces by exploiting their physical strength, the teams in the southern hemisphere try to overwhelm them with quick attacks by moving the ball. Japanese rugby does not fit into those patterns.</p>
<p>Both in the 2015 World Cup, with Eddie Jones, and in 2019, in which Jamie Joseph led the team to the quarterfinals, Japan showed off a very own and versatile game, unique in its kind, which allowed it to beat very strong teams and earned him recognition in the rugby world. Against South Africa and Ireland, who dominate set pieces, he used effective kicks to gain advantage by creating unstructured situations; Against Samoa, who excels in this second type of play, they did not move the ball and put pressure on set pieces.</p>
<p>What type of rugby will Japan surprise the world within the next World Cup, which begins in France on September 8?</p>

<p>The action is over and now the waiting begins. One that will be almost four years exactly. It&#8217;s time to prepare for the next edition, which will come with new features.</p>
<p>Australia will host the next biggest event in the sport of oval ball, which will be held on October 1 and November 13. The Oceania country was confirmed as host on May 12, 2022.</p>
<p>Among the candidates were also the names of Argentina, South Africa, Russia, and the United States. The nation of Los Pumas went down when Agust??n Pichot confirmed that the South Americans were far from hosting the tournament due to economic reasons. The COVID-19 pandemic dampened the illusions of South Africans.</p>
<p>Russia did not make the possible force and Australia&#8217;s main rival was the United States, which had tried to host the 2027 and 2031 World Cups, as well as the 2029 women&#8217;s tournament.</p>
<p>However, no bid could make it outside the land of the Wallabies, who will also host the aforementioned Women&#8217;s Rugby World Cup 2029. But two years earlier, World Rugby debuted a new format.</p>
<p>It was confirmed that the next edition of the World Cup will have 24 teams. They will be divided into six groups of four teams each, while the round will be incorporated.</p>
<p>So far, in addition to Australia being host, South Africa, as the maximum historical winner and first four-time rugby world champion team, is already qualified for 2027 along with: the All Blacks, Los Pumas, England, France, Fiji, Ireland, Wales, Italy, Scotland and Japan.</p>

Which nations have qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, and which have already been eliminated?</strong></p>
<p>The 2023 Rugby World Cup is almost at the end of its group stage. And several nations already know their destiny. To date, two teams are assured of qualification for the quarter-finals. Some, on the other hand, have already been eliminated from the competition. Finally, many others are playing big this weekend. <em>Rugby News</em>??tells you everything.</p>
<h2>2023 World Cup: the qualifiers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wales</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first team to qualify for the quarter-finals of the 2023 World Cup. By inflicting a historic defeat on Australia (40-6) last week, Wales also validated their ticket to the next round.</p>
<p>With three wins in three games and 14 points on the clock, the Welsh are guaranteed to finish in the top two of Pool C, even before playing their last match.</p>
<ul>
<li>England</li>
</ul>
<p>The second qualifier for the 2023 World Cup is England. In Pool D, Le XV de la Rose took advantage of Samoa&#8217;s defeat against Japan to validate their place in the quarter-final.</p>
<p>With 14 points on the clock and taking advantage of the bonus points left by their opponents, the English are guaranteed to finish in first place in their group, even before playing their last match.</p>
<h2>2023 World Cup: those eliminated</h2>
<ul>
<li>Namibia</li>
</ul>
<p>In Pool A, Namibia have finished their Rugby World Cup. The Welwitschias have been eliminated for a week and a third defeat in three games. The fourth setback came on Wednesday against Uruguay.</p>
<p>Namibia is the first nation to complete its World Cup. The players will enjoy their last days in Paris and return to the country or their respective clubs at the end of the weekend.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uruguay</li>
</ul>
<p>In the same group, Uruguay is also eliminated from the World Cup. Beaten by France and Ital, Los Teros, winners of Namibia, can no longer hope to finish in the first two of the group. They will play one last match against New Zealand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Romania</li>
</ul>
<p>Romania is already eliminated in Pool B after two crushing defeats against Ireland (82-8) and South Africa (76-0). The Romanians will play against Scotland and Tonga and can hope, at best, for third place, which qualifies for the next Rugby World Cup.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chili</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Chile was officially eliminated from the World Cup in Pool D after three defeats in three matches. The South Americans will finish their competition this weekend with a final game against Argentina.</p>
<ul>
<li>Georgia and Samoa</li>
</ul>
<p>This Saturday, September 30, 2 new teams were eliminated. Amoa said goodbye to the 2023 Rugby World Cup with Argentina&#8217;s victory. For its part, Georgia, which did not win any of its first three matches, was officially eliminated after its defeat against Fiji (17-12).</p>

<p>This Thursday, activity resumed at the France 2023 Rugby World Cup, after four consecutive days without matches after the first day of the group stage. At the beginning of the second round, France, which in the first match defeated no less than New Zealand by 27 to 13, struggled to carry out a game against Uruguay in which it started as a large favorite. Meanwhile, the All Blacks brought out their entire hierarchy against a clearly inferior rival and beat it: Namibia.</p>
<p>The Teros charr??as, who debuted in the World Cup against the local team after having a free date in the first week, gave a great show of character and, despite not achieving a good result, were recognized for their bravery at the time to face one of the leading candidates for the title. After 80 regulation minutes, the match ended 27-12 for the French team.</p>
<p class="com-paragraph --s">The day continued on Friday with New Zealand&#8217;s 71-3 victory over Namibia.??The All Blacks, who in their debut against France suffered their first defeat in a group stage of a World Cup, left no room for doubt against an inferior opponent, who suffered a serious injury to one of their most important players, Le Roux Malan, when just 17??? had elapsed into the first stage (exposed tibia fracture).</p>
<p class="com-paragraph --s">The initial stage of the World Cup, the zones, will conclude on October 8 after 40 matches.??The best two from each will advance to the quarterfinals and fight for the title, which will be settled in the final on October 28 at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. All championship matches are broadcast live on Star+.??Those of the Argentine team can also be seen on ESPN and Public TV and on the digital platforms, Flow, DGO, and Telecentro Play.</p>

<p>The Rugby World Cup is well and truly underway.??Since Friday and??the victory of the XV of France in the opening match against New Zealand (27-13), the weekend has been punctuated in Saint-Denis, Bordeaux, Marseille, Saint-??tienne, and Toulouse.??Between test festivals, clinched victories??but also first hiccups, the 2023 World Cup has already recorded more than 220,000 spectators over the first eight matches, played between Friday and Sunday.??What to calmly consider the rest of the competition.</p>
<p>If you were expecting to spend another evening watching rugby this Monday, you will however have to wait until Thursday before seeing??Antoine Dupont??and his teammates again.??As per the rules, matches every three days do not exist in rugby due to physical demands. Because of??the impacts suffered, the recovery required between two matches is longer in rugby than in other disciplines.</p>
<p>For this 2023 edition, the organizer World Rugby has decided to extend the schedule to give players more recovery time and preserve their health.</p>
<h2 class="subheading">No longer disadvantage &#8220;small nations&#8221; as in 2019</h2>
<p>Therefore, all teams have a minimum of five rest days between each game.??A way to avoid the errors of the last edition in Japan four years ago, when certain nations had to continue every four days.??For example, Russia had played the opening match against the Japanese on September 20, before continuing against Samoa on the 24th.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that no match is scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. After playing on Friday, the Blues will play on Thursday against Uruguay (9 p.m.), then on the 21st against Namibia, and finally on October 6 against Italy for the last day of the group stage.</p>
