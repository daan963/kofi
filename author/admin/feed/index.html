<p>Any complaint regarding the price of the product can be reported by calling the government service number &#8216;333&#8217;.</p>



<p>State Minister for Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology Junaid Ahmed Palak said in a discussion meeting at the Secretariat on Monday, &#8220;After the spread of the Covid epidemic in 2020, the use of 333 was increased to deliver food to the homes of poor people and to identify patients.</p>



<p>&#8220;Using that experience, an initiative has been taken to link the number 333 with commodity price control.&#8221;</p>



<p>The state minister said that the system of reporting complaints to 333 will be launched within this month.</p>



<p>On this occasion, an urgent discussion meeting was organized with stakeholders on ensuring more transparency in market rates and bringing innovative changes through digitization in this regard.</p>

<p>Representatives of TCB, National Directorate of Consumer Rights Protection, Shop Owners Association, Supershop Owners Association, various corporate groups of consumer goods were present in the meeting.</p>



<p>State Minister Palak said, “333 call centers are already active. A digit will be added there. There the consumer can complain about the price of goods from any market. A website will also be created, where the daily prices will be given.”</p>



<p>He said that the Prime Minister has given instructions in the Cabinet meeting to control the prices of goods in the upcoming fast.</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;Many problems will be solved if accurate data can be stored and exchanged among themselves at the production, storage, marketing, marketing and import stages of any product. We want to use technology to provide its real-time information to the Ministry of Commerce.”</p>

<p>“On the occasion of Ramadan, we will first open a call center. I want to add a digit to the current government information service 333. When everyone provides rice, sugar, potato, oil price information at one place, it will be easy to understand the price of any item in any district or where. If the price of any product falls too much, the administration can immediately go and buy all the products and sell them wherever needed,” said the state minister.</p>

<p><strong>With the strong influence of T20, there is a place for fear about the future of Test cricket. It has been accentuated by recent incidents in South Africa. They have given importance to the domestic T20 tournament by dropping a series that is part of the Test Championship. Based on this, the discussion has started again about the survival of the elite version of cricket. Joined by Brian Lara. The Caribbean wants this batting legend to live on in the glory of the beloved Test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A part of the cricketers have opted for T20 cricket after excluding the Test. There is increasing reluctance in the country&#8217;s central contracts to play franchise cricket. Meanwhile, South Africa has waived Tests to establish their own domestic franchise league. They have made it mandatory for local cricketers to play SA201 before the national team if they get a team.</p>



<p>So the Proteas have to take the Ankora team only once for the tour of New Zealand. Eight new faces in the 15-member squad announced for the two Tests. The combined experience of the remaining 7 is only 50 Tests.</p>



<p>The demand for West Indies cricketers in the franchise leagues is a little higher. They prefer to play in those tournaments over the national team in the hope of earning extra money. Therefore, the Caribbean has to take several new faces on the tour of Australia.</p>



<p>However, Lara does not blame the players here. Talking to &#8216;Da AJ&#8217;, the former West Indies captain said that they are looking for another way because they are not getting financial security for the future by playing for the national team.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t begrudge any player for making financial decisions to secure their future. Sports as a whole are very short-lived. In cricket, you never know when you will be in the team or when you will be out. We need to find a way that not just English, Australian or Indian cricket, but all forms of cricket will prosper.&#8221;</p>



<p>“You want your best team to play international cricket. South Africa will have their own reasons, but when I look at their team I don&#8217;t see a single name that I recognise.&#8221;</p>



<p>Spectators are also losing interest in Test cricket in this era of T20. However, the Test series of India, Australia, England shows some interest. All in all, Lara asked everyone concerned to think beyond these three countries to keep Test cricket alive.</p>



<p>“Having played Test cricket, I don&#8217;t want to see this version die because of love for the game. Hopefully, beyond India, Australia and England, we can bring back its importance to the West Indies, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa.”</p>

<p><strong>Mohammedan turned around a little late after handling the shock of falling back in the beginning. The champions started their journey to the Federation Cup after defeating Chittagong Abahani.</strong></p>



<p>Mohammedan won 2-1 at Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni Stadium in Gopalganj. Mozaffar Mozaffarov made the fate of the match after Zafar Iqbal equalized the team behind Aziz Abolaji Abu.</p>



<p>On this day, the beginning of Mohammedan was simple. The team in the rhythm of the Premier League scored in the 13th minute from a set piece. Sujan Biswas beat Sujan Biswas with an unguarded Nigerian forward, Abu Ghraman, who received the ball from a free kick at the far post.</p>



<p>After falling behind, Mohammedans regained momentum in the game. In first-half stoppage time, Zafar raced over to find the back of the net after Mozaffarov&#8217;s curling free kick went over the wall and hit the post. The white and black jersey holders go to the break with the relief of equality.</p>



<p>In the second half, Mohammedan continued to increase the intensity of the attack. The 11-time champions, second highest in the competition, got the desired goal in the 55th minute.</p>



<p>A defender of Chittagong Abahani could not clear the corner head. The ball went to the far post, from where Emmanuel Sund&#8217;s head keeper Ashraful Islam Rana was blocked by Uzbekistan midfielder Mozaffarov on the return side volley.</p>



<p>After going forward, Mohammedan concentrated on the game keeping the defense frozen. In the 63rd minute, Shahriar Emon could not take a proper header. The gap did not increase as the ball that went up quite high easily deposited in Rana&#8217;s gloves.</p>



<p>At the end, Chittagong Abahani tried desperately to return to the match; But Mohammedan&#8217;s solid defense kept their efforts from outside the box.</p>



<p>In the 85th minute, Rayhan Hasan&#8217;s curling free kick attempted to find the net at the far post. Goalkeeper Sujan kept Mohammedan on the way to victory with a lot of jumps and fists.</p>

<p><strong>Emma Radukanu returned to the court a couple of months ago after being out for a long time due to injury. Now he entered the Grand Slam fight. It&#8217;s great for the British star to be back on the big stage. Shelby swept Rogers in straight sets in the second round of the Australian Open.</strong></p>



<p>The 21-year-old player has not played in any major tournament since the last edition of this competition in Melbourne. He was off the court for about eight months after undergoing wrist and ankle surgery.</p>



<p>On the day he returned to the majors with the first Grand Slam of the year, he defeated Rogers of the United States 6-3, 6-2 on Monday.</p>



<p>At the age of 18, Radukanu rose to the limelight of the tennis world by winning the 2021 US Open. In that incredible campaign, he became the first player in Grand Slam history to win the title after qualifying. An unknown name became a world star.</p>



<p>Later, though, Radukanu could not maintain that early lead. He contracted the coronavirus, followed by injuries, and luck was not on his side. His position is now 296 in the ranking.</p>



<p>However, there is a glimpse of that old rhythm returning to his game. He played excellent serves and groundstrokes on his way to crushing Rogers. Many are looking at how far Radukanu can pull the form.</p>



<p>Radukanu will face China&#8217;s Wang Yafan next Thursday in the fight to advance to the third round.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://media.assettype.com/bdnews24%2F2024-01%2F27b8474d-2335-4ba3-a8fa-b04367ca8759%2Fnaomi_osaka_160124_02.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;format=webp&amp;w=1536" alt="গ্র্যান্ড স্ল্যামে ফেরাটা জয়ে রাঙালেন রাডুকানু"/></figure>



<p>After a long break, the return of another female star Naomi Osaka to the Grand Slam was not pleasant. After the maternity break, she returned to tennis with the Brisbane Open a few days ago. But lost in the second round.</p>



<p>This Japanese lost in the first round in the Australian Open. France&#8217;s Caholin Garcia defeated the two-time champion 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) in this Melbourne competition.</p>



<p>However, the 26-year-old star is not disappointed with this loss. The four-time Grand Slam winner in women&#8217;s singles wants to spend busy time on the front court to regain herself. That&#8217;s how you plan.</p>

<p><strong>FIFA not only honored Marta Vieira de Silva for her long career, but also gave great recognition. The name of the Brazilian great has announced a new award of women&#8217;s football &#8211; &#8216;Marta Award.&#8217;</strong></p>



<p>Marta holds the record for the highest number of goals scored by men and women in the World Cup with 17 goals. He is also the first player to score five consecutive goals on the world stage of football. FIFA honored him with a special trophy at The Best FIFA Football Awards in London on Monday night for his contribution to football for more than 20 years. It was there that the award of the best goal of the year was announced under the name of the women&#8217;s football superstar.</p>



<p>Marta also once held the record for both men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s FIFA Footballer of the Year awards, winning six times. Later he was overtaken by Argentine superstar Lionel Messi. This is the eighth time he has won this year.</p>



<p>FIFA has an award for the best goal of the year. Since 2009, they have been giving the Puskas Award for spectacular goals. The first was won by Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. For a stunning goal from 40 yards for Manchester United in the Champions League quarter-final against Porto.</p>



<p>Real Madrid and Hungary legend Puskas could not see the award launched in his name. He died in 2006, the award was launched in October 2009.</p>



<p>Both male and female footballers were considered for the award, but for the first two years only men were in the top ten. USA&#8217;s Heather O&#8217;Reilly made it to the list of top 10 goals for her great goal against Colombia in 2011 World Cup.</p>



<p>In 2014, a woman made the top three for the first time. Ireland&#8217;s Stephanie Rush finished second behind Colombia&#8217;s James Rodriguez. Since then, only two others &#8211; Daniuska Rodríguez (2016) and Denia Castianos (2017) from Venezuela &#8211; have made the top three.</p>



<p>The Puskas Award is determined by a vote of football fans registered on the FIFA website. There, male footballers who are far ahead in terms of fan base have an added advantage.</p>



<p>Alecia Russo was considered a strong contender last year to become the first female footballer to win the award. The English forward scored a stunning back-heel goal against Sweden at the Women&#8217;s Euros. But he could not come in the top three.</p>



<p>If the Puskas Award had been launched in the previous year instead of 2009, Marta might have been considered. He scored a brilliant goal in the 4-0 World Cup semi-final win over the USA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marta is very happy to receive the award in her own name.</p>



<p>“Of course, it (becoming a record six FIFA Man of the Year) gives me great joy. But this recognition elevates not only Marta, but all of us—Brazil as a nation.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I will not play again in the World Cup. I am very happy with the way women&#8217;s football has developed in Brazil and in the world. There are incredibly talented girls who have great futures ahead of them. It&#8217;s just the beginning for them, but the end for me.&#8221;</p>
