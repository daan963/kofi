<p>The crowd of star cricketers is increasing now in the national elections. Former national team captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza has become a member of parliament for the second time.The current captain Shakib Al Hasan has also become a member of Parliament this time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of them are still playing. They will also play in the BPL starting tomorrow. Mashrafe Sylhet Strikers and Shakib&#8217;s team Rangpur Riders. Tamim Iqbal is a long time teammate of these two. Will you congratulate them for being members of parliament?</p>



<p>In response to such a question, he told reporters after the practice of Fortune Barisal at BKSP on Thursday, &#8220;None of the two have met me yet. If we meet, we will definitely talk. Let&#8217;s see what happens then. &#8216;</p>



<p>International cricket is almost at an end for Tamim too. Now the question in the minds of many is whether Tamim will ever be elected? He did not want to answer such questions directly. However, he claims that there is no such plan so far. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;This is a very risky thing, brother. I said no, then it happened after ten years. Then you&#8217;ll pretend I wasn&#8217;t saying that. Never say no to anything. But as of now I have no such plans. &#8216;</p>



<p>Current BCB President Nazmul Hasan Papon has taken charge as Sports Minister. He also said to leave the responsibility of the board. Shakib said that he wants to go and take this responsibility at some point. Tamim also has such a dream?</p>



<p>He said, &#8216;You never know where the future will take you. If Allah writes something like that on my forehead, it will happen automatically. I can&#8217;t take it by force. &#8216;</p>

<p>Injuries and injuries have never left Taskin Ahmed behind. However, he has established his name in the country&#8217;s cricket.This pacer is now playing regularly for the national team in all three formats. Even in the captaincy race, his name came up often. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Taskin is injury prone. Often has to stay out of the game. Still, he dreams of becoming the captain of the national team. Dhaka&#8217;s vice-captain Taskin is great in the upcoming BPL. Faced with the media on Thursday, he also expressed his desire to lead the national team.</p>



<p>He said, &#8216;Yes, of course. Why not, every player has a dream. Everything will happen step by step. &#8216;</p>



<p>Regarding being the co-captain of Dhaka, Taskin said, &#8216;Our team is very young. Sujan Sir is there, Mosaddek is there, I am also there, there are many other experienced cricketers. May be subject to availability many foreign cricketers will arrive late, some may not be available on time. &#8216;</p>



<p>&#8220;If we can organize the existing team and play with unity, it will definitely be a good thing. I will always try to share my own experiences for the team. So that our team will benefit. &#8216;</p>



<p>Great Dhaka could not build a very strong team in this year&#8217;s BPL. Taskin is the biggest star of the team. However, Taskin is hoping for good things with the team. He wants to do something useful for his performance as well as the team.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Taskin said, &#8216;Actually in T20 cricket, on a given day, you always have to play according to the situation. Apart from that, sometimes not much happens. From tomorrow our tournament will start the goal will be the same thing another new season is starting always the same game just the name is BPL. There is always pressure in the game. ’</p>



<p>If I can use the power that I have, nothing new. At the end of the day, the result will count how well I can perform. Keeping the basics right and sharpening my performance to be effective for the team. &#8216;</p>

<p><strong>Age 36; Lionel Messi has even left Europe and moved to American football. In his absence, the three best forwards of all time, Arling Haaland, Kylian Mbappé and Vinicius Junior, have been rocking Europe.</strong><strong>However, Messi got a place in the FIFA XI of the Year. But there was no place for Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>



<p>The best XI of the year was announced today at &#8216;The Best FIFA Football Awards&#8217; in London. Considering the performance of the period from December 19, 2022 to August 20, 2023, all 6 of this eleven are treble-winning Manchester City. And three people got a place from Real Madrid.</p>



<p>All three defenders in the FIFA XI of the Year are City &#8211; John Stones, Kyle Walker and Ruben Dias. Even two of the three midfielders, Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva, are members of the same club. The third is Real Madrid&#8217;s English star Jude Bellingham.</p>



<p>There are four forwards in the XI. One of them is Argentina&#8217;s World Cup-winning captain Messi. With him in the attack is Norwegian striker Haaland, the main hero of City&#8217;s treble-winning team. Their partner in attack is Mbappe of French champion PSG and Real star Vinicius.</p>



<p>Thibaut Courtois is the goalkeeper of the XI. &nbsp;</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><br>Mashrafe will play in BPL from the first match</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.banglanews24.com/public/uploads/2024/01/18/1705575778.Mash.jpg" alt="Mashrafe will play in BPL from the first match"/></figure>



<p><strong>It was almost evening. Mashrafe bin Murtaza suddenly came out of the pandal made in the academy ground.</strong><strong>The instability of the camera remained to capture him. He tried to run two or three times, but it didn&#8217;t seem like he could do much good. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Mashrafe&#8217;s old leg pain increased after the election campaign. Meanwhile Sylhet Strikers announced him as the captain. However, there was still uncertainty whether Mashrafe would play from the first match or not. However, the vice-captain of the team Mohammad Mithun said on Thursday, &#8220;As far as we know, he is available. &#8216;</p>



<p>Mashrafe joined Sylhet&#8217;s practice for a while on Thursday. But this time batting-bowling did nothing. Yet the whole team looked motivated. Mohammad Mithun says, Mashrafe is always like this. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He said, &#8216;Bhai Mashrafe is not like this now, he was like this before. Blend in with the team very quickly. When he came to the field yesterday, he didn&#8217;t practice but he made a match in the 10-15 minutes he was with the team. We all know how Mashrafe Bhai is, no one will have any difficulty in getting along with him. &#8216;</p>



<p>There was a lot of discussion and criticism before the start of last season&#8217;s BPL. The lack of DRS was also talked about a lot. What difference do you see this time with the last season? Such a question was asked to Mithun. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;As players, we don&#8217;t look for so much difference. We are busy preparing how we can do better. We are looking into that. If the difference is, as I said in the team meeting yesterday, DRS is there from the beginning, it is certainly something to be applauded. &#8216;</p>



<p>The purpose of the tournament is to improve our native cricketers. Of course, domestic players always have a chance. Because it is our only tournament coverage, it is called our biggest stage. The highlights are good if you perform here. That&#8217;s why all our cricketers try to talk about the best performance in BPL. &#8216;</p>
